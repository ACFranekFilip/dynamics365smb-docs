# Creating Reports With XBRL
XBRL, which stands for eXtensible Business Reporting Language, is an XML-based language for tagging financial data, and enabling businesses to efficiently and accurately process and share their data. The XBRL initiative enables global financial reporting by numerous ERP software companies and international accounting organizations. The goal of the initiative is to provide a standard for the uniform reporting of financial information for banks, investors, and government authorities. Such business reporting can include:

• Financial statements

• Financial information

• Non-financial information

• Regulatory filings, such as annual and quarterly financial statements

Microsoft Dynamics NAV enables companies to implement data in XBRL, and take advantage of the flexibility and automation it provides for both collecting and sharing data.
