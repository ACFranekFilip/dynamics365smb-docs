# Managing Inventory Costs
Cost management, also referred to as “costing”, is concerned with recording and reporting business operating costs. This business discipline is well supported by Microsoft Dynamics NAV.  

 The documentation for cost management consists firstly of a number of conceptual topics that provide both general and specific insight into the definitions and mechanisms of the costing engine. Secondly, a sequenced list of typical cost control tasks are presented under the heading Manage Inventory and Manufacturing Costs. Period-end tasks around reporting inventory value to the general ledger is covered in a group of help topics aimed at auditors and cost controllers. Lastly, detailed descriptions of how the costing system is designed are provided. This information is built mainly from the Inventory Costing technical white paper, which is also published on PartnerSource.  

 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them. These tasks are listed in the order in which they are generally performed.
