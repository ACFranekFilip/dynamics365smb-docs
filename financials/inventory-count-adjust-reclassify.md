# How to: Count, Adjust, and Reclassify Inventory
At least once every fiscal year you must take a physical inventory, that is, count all the items on inventory, to see if the quantity registered in the database is the same as the actual physical quantity in the warehouses. When the actual physical quantity is known, it must be posted to the general ledger as a part of period-end valuation of inventory.

If you need to adjust recorded inventory quantities, in connection with counting or for other purposes, you can use an item journal to change the inventory ledger entries directly without posting business transactions.

If you need to change attributes on item ledger entries as well as the quantities, you can use the item reclassification journal. Typical attributes to reclassify include serial/lot numbers, expiration dates, and variant codes.

## To adjust the inventory quantity of one or more items
In the **Item Journal** window, you can post item transaction directly to adjust inventory in connection with purchases, sales, and positive or negative adjustments without using documents.

If you often use the item journal to post the same or similar journal lines, for example, in connection with material consumption, you can use the **Standard Item Journal** window to make this recurring work easier. For more information, see kl-nhhkiknh.

1. In the top right corner, choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon, enter **Item Journals**, and then choose the related link
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. Choose the **Post** action to make the inventory adjustments.
