# Extend Dynamics 365 for Financials
There are plenty of benefits of using Dynamics 365 for Financials as a platform for App builders:

* Enrich Dynamics 365 for Financials, a proven Microsoft online solution, with your expertise  
* Leverage the Dynamics 365 brand – a brand that millions of users know and trust  
* Reach more customers for your business apps with [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/)  
* Achieve more with a platform that delivers a modern experience and offers scale  
* Bundle with intelligent business apps such as PowerApps, Flow, Power BI, Cortana Intelligence, and many more  

## To bring your Financials app into AppSource:
1. Create your accounts
   We want you to have access to all the necessary tools! You must have a Microsoft Partner Network ID, a Developer account, and a PSBC account.
   For more information about how you can get your accounts in place, see the [Create Your Accounts document in PartnerSource](https://mbs.microsoft.com/Files/partner/365/Essentials/Createyouraccounts.pdf).
2. Engage with us about your app idea
   Share your Financials app idea with us on Microsoft AppSource! After submitting your idea, we will engage with you and provide you with everything you need to start working on your app.
   For more information about all the steps, see the [Engage with us about your app idea document in PartnerSource](https://mbs.microsoft.com/Files/partner/365/Essentials/Engagewithusaboutyourappidea.pdf).
3. Develop your app
   After you have set up your own app development environment, you can develop your app.
   For more information about everything you need to know about how to develop a Financials app, see the [Develop Your App document in PartnerSource](https://mbs.microsoft.com/Files/partner/365/Essentials/Developyourapp.pdf).
4. Publish your app
   Before we publish, we will collaborate with you to ensure that your app stands out on Microsoft AppSource and on your own landing page! We need to validate your app to ensure it is marketed well, trustworthy, and up to date.
   For more information about the validation process and how to publish your app, see the [Publish your app document in PartnerSource](https://mbs.microsoft.com/Files/partner/365/Essentials/Publishyourapp.pdf).
