# How to: Track Relations Between Demand and Supply
From any supply or demand docum,ent in the so-called order network, you can track the order demand (tracked quantity), forecast, blanket sales order, or planning parameter (untracked quantity) that has given rise to the planning line in question.

The planning worksheets also offers supporting planning information about non-order entities, in the **Untracked Planning Elements** window, to help the planner obtain an optimal supply plan.
