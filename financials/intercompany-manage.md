# Managing Intercompany Posting
Your organization may consist of several companies, but might not have the equivalent number of accounting and administrative teams. The Intercompany Posting feature lets you do business with your subsidiary and internal partner organizations in the same way as you engage with your external vendors and customers. You enter intercompany transaction information only once in the appropriate documents. You can use the functionality you are already familiar with, such as receivables and payables management. Mapping facilities for the chart of accounts and dimensions help ensure that information appears in the right places.  

You are in full control of all transaction documents. For example, you can reject a document sent to you and, in this way, reverse postings that were incorrect. Or, when making a purchase from a partner or subsidiary company, you can update the purchase order as long as the selling company has not shipped any goods.  

When you enter a transaction, you do not need to specify the accounts for an individual set of books, but simply give the identification of the partner company. Intercompany Postings creates General Journal lines that result – as soon as they are posted – in the balancing of the books of both companies involved in a transaction. In Receivables and Payables, you assign an intercompany partner code to any customer or vendor. From that moment on, all orders and invoices generated pertaining to transactions with these companies will produce corresponding documents in the partner company, resulting in correct balancing of the accounts.  

Intercompany Postings functionality focuses on supporting intercompany transactions with sales and purchasing documents, and with General Journal lines. Within this area, Intercompany Postings allows intercompany transactions between multiple \($ P\_1 Product Name $\) databases, for example, in different countries\/regions, as well as multiple currencies, different charts of accounts, different dimensions, and different item numbering.  

There are four main benefits to Intercompany Postings:  

- Increased productivity as a result of time saved and simplified transactions  
- Minimized error potential with one\-time entry of information and system\-wide, automated updates  
- Complete audit trail and full visibility into business activities and transaction histories  
- Efficient, cost\-effective transactions with affiliate and subsidiary companies  

Intercompany Postings lets you distribute sales and purchasing documents, as well as General Journal entries to all of your satellite offices, sales offices, or subsidiary companies, from within the program. Savings of time and increased efficiencies result throughout the organization as you eliminate redundant data entry and the sending, receiving, printing, and archiving of the sales and purchasing documents on paper.

 After you set up business partners as customers and vendors in the system, and assign them intercompany partner codes, it is possible to exchange intercompany purchase and sales documents, including items and item charges. The receivables and payables functionality includes the capability of handling different currencies; intercompany transactions can proceed in any required currency.  

When you make full use of the capabilities of intercompany posting, individual transactions can become elements in a single, fully connected accounting process with a complete audit trail of business activities between your partner and subsidiary companies.
