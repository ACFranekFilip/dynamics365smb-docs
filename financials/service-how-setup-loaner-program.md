# How to: Set Up a Loaner Program
Sometimes you must provide a customer a loaner item for use when your customer service team makes a repair. Using Microsoft Dynamics NAV, you can set up a loaner program, loan your customers items, and track the receipt of the items back. In addition, you may choose to add notes about loaners, by using one of two ways to register comments:  
  
* Enter a note or comment about the loaner itself.  
* Enter a note on a service item about the need for a loaner.  

## To set up a loaner  
1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Loaners**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new loaner card. On the **Home** tab, in the **New** group, choose **New**.  
3. In the **No.** field, enter a number for the loaner.  
  
     Alternatively, if you have set up number series for loaners in the **Service Mgt. Setup** window, you can press the Enter key to enter the next available loaner number.  
  
4. Fill in the **Description**, **Description 2**, and **Serial No.** fields.  
5. In the **Unit of Measure Code** field, choose the relevant unit of measure.
