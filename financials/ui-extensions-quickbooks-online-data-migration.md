# The QuickBooks Online Data Migration Extension for Dynamics 365 for Financials
This extension is included in the **Data Migration** assisted setup guide to help you migrate important business data from QuickBooks Online to [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. For example, this is useful when your business is growing, and you've decided to upgrade your business management app by starting to use [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)].

## What data can I import from QuickBooks Online?
You can import the following data from QuickBooks Online to [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]:  

* Customers
* Vendors
* Items
* Chart of accounts 
* Beginning balance transaction in the general ledger
* On-hand quantities for inventory items
* Outstanding documents for customers and vendors, such as invoices, credit memos, and payments

## Before you start
The biggest part of the migration process is specifying the accounts that you'll migrate transactions to. For example, the accounts you use for the sale or purchase of items and services. Before you migrate data, it's a good idea to have planned this mapping.

## How do I start using the extension?
Getting started is easy. All you need to do is run the **Data Migration** assisted setup guide. Here's how:

1. In the top right corner, choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon, enter **Assisted Setup**, and then choose **Migrate business data**.
2. Follow the instructions on each step in the assisted setup guide.
