# How to: Open a New Fiscal Year
Before you can post in a fiscal year, you must open the fiscal year and define its accounting periods.

## To open a new fiscal year
1. In the top right corner, choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon"), enter **Accounting Periods**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Accounting Periods** window, choose the **Create Year** action.
3. Fill in the fields to define the structure of the fiscal year.

    The fiscal year is typically 12 periods of one month each, but you can also divide it in other ways.
4. Choose the **OK** button.

The accounting periods are added to the page. The **Starting Date** and **Name** fields are filled in. The **Name** field uses the name of the month from the starting date. After the last period in the fiscal year, an accounting period is inserted and the **New Fiscal Year** check box is selected.
