# Business Intelligence
Businesses capture a tremendous amount of data through daily activity. This data, which reflects such things as the organization's sales figures, purchases, operational expenses, employee salaries, and budgets, can become valuable information, or business intelligence, for decision makers. [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] contains a number of features that help you gather, analyze, and share your company data.

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.
