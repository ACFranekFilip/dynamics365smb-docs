# Configure Sales Processes
Before you can manage sales processes, you must configure the rules and values that define the company's sales policies.  
  
 First, you must define the general setup, such as which sales documents are required and how their values are posted. This general setup is typically performed once during the initial implementation. Initial setup values may be set up automatically with the Setup Questionnaire, which is a component of the Rapid Implementation Methodology toolkit.  
  
 You must also identify and register customer information on a periodic or daily basis. Each customer is represented as a customer card that holds master data to define the rules and values that apply to the customer.  
  
 A separate series of tasks related to creating customer master data is to record the customers' discount and price agreements in windows linked to the customer cards.  
  
 Finance\-related sales configuration, such as payment and reminder handling, are covered in [Set Up Receivables and Payables](../Finance/set-up-receivables-and-payables.md).  
  
 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them. These tasks are listed in the order in which they are generally performed.
