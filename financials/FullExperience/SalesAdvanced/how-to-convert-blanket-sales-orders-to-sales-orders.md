# How to: Convert Blanket Sales Orders to Sales Orders
You can either convert an entire blanket order into one order, or you can make it into a number of separate orders, depending upon how you want the blanket order to be invoiced.  
  
 You must have already set up a blanket order.  
  
### To convert a blanket sales order to a sales order  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Blanket Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Open the relevant blanket sales order.  
  
3.  On the **Shipping** FastTab, in the **Shipment Date** field, type the same date as the date in the **Shipment Date** field on the first line.  
  
4.  To create an order out of only one blanket order line, fill in the **Qty. to Ship** field on the relevant line.  
  
5.  On the **Actions** tab, in the **General** group, choose **Make Order**.  
  
 A message appears informing you that the blanket order has been assigned an order number. You can see the new sales order in the [sales order list](DynamicsNAV:////runpage?Page=9305). Note that the blanket order has not been deleted.
