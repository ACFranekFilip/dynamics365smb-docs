# How to: View Customer Statistics by Currencies
When you have posted an invoice in multiple currencies, you can see the customerâ€™s status for each currency for which there are transactions.  
  
### To view customer statistics by currencies  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Open the relevant **Customer** card.  
  
3.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **History** group, choose **Statistics by Currencies**. The **Customer Stats. by Currencies** window opens. Each line shows the transaction statistics for the customer in the currency on the line.
