# Manage Sales Returns
Compensating a customer who is dissatisfied with an item that a company has sold them is a necessary and important transaction between a company and its customer. The faster and more accurately a company carries out the activities involved in a return process, the more likely the company is to foster the customer's perception of good customer service.  
  
 Typically, the salesperson responsible for the interface with certain customers would also be the contact person to receive complaints from those customers about the items sold. In other cases, a company may have a dedicated person(s) specifically dealing with returns; for example, employees in the customer service department.  
  
 Irrespective of the industry in which that company operates, the typical customer-oriented return handling process includes the following tasks:  
  
-   Determine a compensation agreement with the customer.  
  
-   Shipping a replacement item(s) to the customer (if replacement is part of the compensation agreement).  
  
-   Crediting the customer (either by means of a credit for physically returned items or a sales allowance where the customer is not required to physically return the items).  
  
-   Shipping a repaired item(s) to the customer (if repair is a part of a compensation agreement).  
  
-   Follow-up on the return status (in case of customer inquiries).  
  
 Related to the customer-facing process, there are a number of internal handling tasks:  
  
-   Receiving returned items and inspecting them (if relevant).  
  
-   Applying restock charges.  
  
-   Shipping returned items to the vendor for repair.  
  
-   Ensuring the accurate inventory value of the returned items.  
  
 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them. These tasks are listed in the order in which they are generally performed.
