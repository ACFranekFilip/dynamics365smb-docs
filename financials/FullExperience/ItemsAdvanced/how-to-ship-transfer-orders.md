# How to: Ship Transfer Orders
When you have created a transfer order by filling in all the necessary information, you can post the shipment. If there is an error, it will interrupt the posting process and display an error message.  
  
### To ship a transfer order  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Transfer Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Create the transfer order. For more information, see [How to: Create Transfer Orders](../DesignAndEngineering/how-to-create-transfer-orders.md).  
  
3.  On the **Actions** tab, in the **Release** group, choose **Release**.  
  
4.  Post the transfer order or, if you want to print the transfer order, on the **Actions** tab, in the **Posting** group, choose **Post and Print** instead.  
  
5.  Select **Ship** in the message box, and then choose the **OK** button.
