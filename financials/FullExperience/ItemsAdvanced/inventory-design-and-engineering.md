    description: There are many common processes in central design and engineering work, such as specifying how and when items are handled. For example, you can specify whether items are just purchased and sold, or are manufactured from components before sale. For the first design tasks, you need to define rules and values for all items by completing item cards with specific master data. Lastly, for produced items, you must define the material structures and process structures in master data records for specific production BOMs and routings.

# Design and Engineering
There are many common processes in central design and engineering work, such as specifying how and when items are handled. For example, you can specify whether items are just purchased and sold, or are manufactured from components before sale. For the first design tasks, you need to define rules and values for all items by completing item cards with specific master data. Lastly, for produced items, you must define the material structures and process structures in master data records for specific production BOMs and routings.  
  
 A related set of production setup is to [configure production processes](../production.md) department.  
  
 The data and setup that you enter during design and engineering is later used in sales and operations when the item is handled.  
  
 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them. These tasks are listed in the order in which they are generally performed.
