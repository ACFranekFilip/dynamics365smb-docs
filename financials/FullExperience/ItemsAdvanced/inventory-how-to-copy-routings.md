# How to: Copy Routings
You can copy routings. This is useful for long routings or when slight changes are to be made. You can copy an existing version of a routing into a new or existing one. The copy function deletes old lines in the current routing.  
  
### To copy routings  
  
1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Routings**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  If you want to create a new routing, fill in the **No.** field of the new routing.  
  
     To copy to an existing routing, select the routing you want to copy to. Check whether this version is to be overwritten and make sure the status is not set to **Certified**.  
  
3.  On the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Copy Routing**. A routing list opens.  
  
     Select the routing you want to copy from, and choose the **OK** button.  
  
     The routing lines of the source version are copied into the current version and can be further processed from there.  
  
4.  Change the **Status** field to **Certified**.
