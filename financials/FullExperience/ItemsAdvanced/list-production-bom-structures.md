# List Production BOM Structures
The structure of the production BOM can be represented by reports. For representation of a BOM, all levels are observed, that is, the production BOM is completely exploded.  
  
 For use, evaluations and representations of the BOMs, the starting date of the version is always important as a filter criterion. All evaluations of the production BOMs refer to a defined period which needs to be specified or preset.  
  
 You can choose between two reports which display the BOM data in detail:  
  
-   Quantity Explosion of BOM  
  
-   Cost Share Explosion of BOM
