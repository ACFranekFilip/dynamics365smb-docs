# How to: Set Up Item Tracking Codes
An item tracking code reflects the different considerations a company has regarding the use of serial and lot numbers for items moving through the inventory.  
  
 For more information about the various setup fields that define a company's item tracking policies, see the **Item Tracking Code** table.  
  
### To set up an item tracking code  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Item Tracking Codes**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Create a new **Item Tracking Code** card. On the **Home** tab, in the **New** group, choose **New**.  
  
3.  On the **General** FastTab, enter a code and a descriptive name in the fields.  
  
4.  On the **Serial No.** and the **Lot No.** FastTabs, define policies of item tracking by serial and lot numbers respectively.  
  
5.  On the **Misc.** FastTab, set parameters for warranty and expiration.  
  
 For more information about item tracking parameters, select a field and press the F1 key.
