    title: How to: Set Up Routing Link Codes | Microsoft Docs
    description: The BOM position is not assigned to a special position in the routing but to a routing link code in the **Production BOM** window. The routing line is also assigned to a routing link code in the **Routing** window. [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)] is very flexible due to this linking of BOM and routing. The positions can be changed as required, without changing the relationships between the BOM and the routing.

# How to: Set Up Routing Link Codes
The BOM position is not assigned to a special position in the routing but to a routing link code in the **Production BOM** window. The routing line is also assigned to a routing link code in the **Routing** window. [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)] is very flexible due to this linking of BOM and routing. The positions can be changed as required, without changing the relationships between the BOM and the routing.  
  
### To set up routing link codes  
  
1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Routing Links**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **Code** field, enter any combination of numbers and letters that uniquely identify the routing link code.  
  
3.  In the **Description** field, enter a text that describes the routing link code.
