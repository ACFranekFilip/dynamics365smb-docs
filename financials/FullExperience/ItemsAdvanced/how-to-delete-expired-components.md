# How to: Delete Expired Components
Periodically, you can run the **Delete Expired Components** batch job to maintain the BOM lines. Old lines where ending dates have expired can be removed from the BOM. The BOM headers are not changed.  
  
### To delete expired components  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Delete Expired Components**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Enter the filters to select the production BOM lines to be deleted.  
  
3.  In the **Delete Before** field, enter the date through which all components will be deleted.  
  
4.  Choose the **OK** button to delete the expired components.
