### To calculate low\-level codes  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Manufacturing Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  On the **General** FastTab, clear the **Dynamic Low\-Level Code** field, and then close the **Manufacturing Setup** window.  
  
3.  In the **Search** box, enter **Calculate Low\-Level Code**, and then choose the related link. The **Calculate Low\-Level Code** batch job opens. Choose the **Yes** button to calculate the low\-level codes.
