# How to: Find Where Routings Are Used
You can use the **Where-used** function to find out which items use a certain routing.  
  
### To find where routings are used  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Routings**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Open the relevant routing from the list.  
  
3.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Routing** group, choose **Where-Used**.   
    The **Where-Used** window shows all items in which reference is made to this routing in the **Routing No.** field.  
  
4.  Close the window.
