# About Correcting Serial Numbers and Lot Numbers for Items in Inventory
If you discover that you have used the wrong serial or lot number for items posted to your inventory, you can always go back and correct the numbers by using a reclassification journal. For more information on using the reclassification journal, see [How to: Reclassify Lot Numbers and Serial Numbers](../DesignAndEngineering/how-to-reclassify-lot-numbers-and-serial-numbers.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If the item is in a location that uses directed put\-away and pick and the item tracking code is set up for warehouse\-specific item tracking, you must use the warehouse reclassification journal to make these changes.
