# Purpose of the Routings
Manufacturing companies use routings to show the manufacturing process. The program offers facilities for entering the manufacturing process, both in terms of chronology and capacity. The routings therefore form the basis for the manufacturing.  
  
 The program supports the production of part families, that is, identical or similar parts can be manufactured with a single routing.  
  
 The routing is the basis of process scheduling, capacity scheduling, and optionally of scheduled assignment of material needs (manufacturing-synchronous planning) and manufacturing documents.  
  
 In order to be able to work with routings, the master data of the capacity planning must be set up first.  
  
 The routings are assigned to the articles in the item master data.
