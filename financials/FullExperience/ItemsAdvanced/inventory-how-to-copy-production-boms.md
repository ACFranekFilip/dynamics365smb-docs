# How to: Copy Production BOMs
You can copy production BOMs. Make sure that the BOM you copy to is not certified. The item lines in the BOM you are copying to are replaced by the lines in the BOM you are copying from.  
  
### To copy production BOMs  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Production BOM**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the BOM you want to copy to, or create a new BOM.  
  
3.  On the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** gorup, choose **Copy BOM**.  
  
4.  Select the BOM to copy from.  
  
5.  Choose the **OK** button to copy the lines into the current BOM.  
  
6.  Close the window.
