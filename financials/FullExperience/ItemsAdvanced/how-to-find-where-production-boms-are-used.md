# How to: Find Where Production BOMs Are Used
The **Prod. BOM Where\-Used** window displays where a production BOM is used.  
  
### To find where production BOMs are used  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Production BOM**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Open the relevant production BOM from the list.  
  
3.  Select an item line, and on the **Navigate** tab, in the **Prod. BOM** group, choose **Where\-Used**.  
  
     The quantity in the **Quantity Needed** field specifies the quantity including scrap percentage.  
  
     The indentation in the **Description** field shows the level of use.  
  
4.  Close the window.
