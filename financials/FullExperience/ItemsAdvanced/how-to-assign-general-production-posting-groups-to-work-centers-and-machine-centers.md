# How to: Assign General Production Posting Groups to Work Centers and Machine Centers
You must assign a general product posting group to each work center and machine center in order to set up capacity and subcontractor costing.  
  
### To assign general production posting groups  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Work Centers**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Open the relevant **Work Center** card.  
  
3.  On the **Posting** FastTab, fill in the **Gen. Prod. Posting Group** field.  
  
 You use the same procedure to assign a general product posting group to a machine center from the **Machine Center** card.
