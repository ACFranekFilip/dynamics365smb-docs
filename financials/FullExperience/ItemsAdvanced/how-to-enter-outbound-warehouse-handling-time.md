2.  On the **General** FastTab, in the **Outbound Whse. Handling Time** field, enter the number of days you want to include in the order promising calculation.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If you have filled in the **Outbound Whse. Handling Time** field on the Location card for your location, this field is used as the default outbound warehouse handling time.  
  
### To enter outbound warehouse handling time on location cards
