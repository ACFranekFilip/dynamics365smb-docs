# How to: Set Up Responsibility Centers in Inventory
You can set up responsibility centers to help administer your business.  
  
 A responsibility center can be a cost center, a profit center, or an investment center. Examples of responsibility centers are a sales office, a purchasing department for several locations, and a plant planning office.  
  
 A responsibility center can, for example, administer sales and purchases for one or more warehouses or distribution centers where goods are handled and stored prior to use.  
  
### To set up a responsibility center  
  
1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Responsibility Centers**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Create a new **Responsibility Center** card. On the **Home** tab, in the **New** group, choose **New**.  
  
3.  Fill in the fields.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  When you enter a responsibility center code on a document, it affects the address, dimensions, and prices on the document.
