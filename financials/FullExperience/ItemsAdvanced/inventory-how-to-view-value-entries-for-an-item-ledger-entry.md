2.  Select the item whose value entries you want to see.  
  
3.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **History** group, choose the **Entries** button, and then choose **Ledger Entries** to see a list of item ledger entries.  
  
4.  In the **Item Ledger Entries** window, select the item ledger entry that you want to know more about.  
  
5.  On the **Home** tab, in the **Entry**  group, choose **Value Entries**. The **Value Entries** window opens showing one or more value entries for the selected item ledger entry.
