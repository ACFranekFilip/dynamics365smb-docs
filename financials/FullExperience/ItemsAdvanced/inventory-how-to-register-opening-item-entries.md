# How to: Register Opening Item Entries
To record inventory on hand of individual items, you must post an entry for each item number. Before you can do this, you must set up all your items on item cards.  
  
### To register opening item entries  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Item Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Fill in a line in the item journal for every item. In the **Entry Type** field, select **Positive Adjmt**.  
  
3.  In the **Unit Amount** field, enter the price per unit of the item so that the item card is updated with the correct direct unit cost and unit cost. The total amount of the posted item entries, the total of all amounts in the **Amount** field in the item journal, must correspond to the amount posted to the general ledger account for inventory.
