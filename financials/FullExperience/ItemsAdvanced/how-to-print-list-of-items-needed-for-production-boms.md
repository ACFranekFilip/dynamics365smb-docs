# How to: Print List of Items Needed for Production BOMs
The **Quantity Explosion of BOM** report gives you a list of the item quantities of the selected BOM. The production BOM is exploded entirely over all levels and printed position by position. The exploded levels are ordered according to their origin of need.  
  
### To print the quantities of items needed for BOMs  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **\($ R\_99000753 Quantity Explosion of BOM $\)**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  On the **Item** FastTab, you can define filters to restrict the report to certain items. All fields of the item master data can be selected as filter criteria.  
  
3.  On the **Options** FastTab, you can specify the date the report is to be calculated on.  
  
4.  Choose **Print** to print the report or **Preview** to see the report on the screen.
