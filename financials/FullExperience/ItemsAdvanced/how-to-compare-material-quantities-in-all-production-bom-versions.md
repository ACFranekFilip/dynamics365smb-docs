# How to: Compare Material Quantities in All Production BOM Versions
The version matrix function offers a comparison of material quantities for each version.  
  
### To compare material quantities for all production BOMs  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Production BOM**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Prod. BOM** group, choose **Matrix per Version**.  
  
3.  In the **Prod. BOM Matrix per Version** window, select either **Single** or **Multi** to set a filter for the matrix. On the **Actions** tab, choose **Show Matrix**.  
  
     The matrix is divided into two parts: the material, on the left side, and the versions, on the right side. The contents of the matrix is given by the material quantities for each version.  
  
4.  To display the **Item** card, select a line, and on the **Navigate** tab, in the **Item** group, choose **Card**.  
  
5.  Close the window.
