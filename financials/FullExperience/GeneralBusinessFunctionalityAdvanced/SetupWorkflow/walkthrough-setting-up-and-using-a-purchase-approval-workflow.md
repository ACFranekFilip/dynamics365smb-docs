# Use Workflows
You can set up and use workflows that connect business-process tasks performed by different users. System tasks, such as automatic posting, can be included as steps in workflows, preceded or followed by user tasks. Requesting and granting approval to create new records are typical workflow steps.  
  
 Before you can begin to use workflows, you must set up workflow users, create the workflows, potentially preceded by code customization and specify how users receive notifications. For more information, see [Set Up Workflows](../../BusinessFunctionality/Workflow/set-up-workflows.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Typical workflow steps are about users who request approval of tasks and approvers accepting or rejecting approval requests. Therefore, many topics about how to use workflows refer to approval steps.  
  
 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.
