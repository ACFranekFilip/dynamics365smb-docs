# How to: View Archived Workflow Step Instances
All completed workflow step instances are saved in the **Archived Workflow Step Instances** window.  
  
 In the **Workflow** window, you create a workflow by listing the involved steps on the lines. Each step consists of a workflow event, moderated by event conditions, and a workflow response, moderated by response options. You define workflow steps by filling fields on workflow lines from fixed lists of event and response values representing scenarios that are supported by the application code. For more information, see [How to: Create Workflows](../../BusinessFunctionality/Workflow/how-to-create-workflows.md).  
  
### To view archived workflow step instances  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Workflows**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Open the workflow for which you want to view all archived workflow step instances.  
  
3.  In the **Workflow** window, on the **Navigate** tab, in the **General** group, choose **Archived Workflow Step Instances**.  
  
     The **Archived Workflow Step Instances** window opens showing the archived workflow step instances of the selected workflow.  
  
4.  Alternatively, in the **Search** box, enter **Archived Workflow Step Instances**, and then choose the related link.  
  
     The **Archived Workflow Step Instances** window opens showing all archived workflow step instances. In the **Workflow Code** field, you can see which workflow the archived workflow step instance belonged to.
