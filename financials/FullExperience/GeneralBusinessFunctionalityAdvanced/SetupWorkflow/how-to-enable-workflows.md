# How to: Enable Workflows
When you have created a workflow and you are sure that it is ready to start, you must enable the workflow.  
  
 In the **Workflow** window, you create a workflow by listing the involved steps on the lines. Each step consists of a workflow event, moderated by event conditions, and a workflow response, moderated by response options. You define workflow steps by filling fields on workflow lines from fixed lists of event and response values representing scenarios that are supported by the application code. For more information, see [How to: Create Workflows](../FullExperience/how-to-create-workflows.md).  
  
### To enable a workflow  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Workflows**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Open the workflow that you want to enable.  
  
3.  In the **Workflow** window, select the **Enabled** check box.
