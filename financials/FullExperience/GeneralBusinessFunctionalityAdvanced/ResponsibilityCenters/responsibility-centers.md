# Responsibility Centers
Responsibility centers providing the ability to handle administrative centers. A responsibility center can be a cost center, a profit center, an investment center, or other company\-defined administrative center. Examples of responsibility centers are a sales office, a purchasing department for several locations, and a plant planning office. Using this functionality, for example, companies can set up user\-specific views of sales and purchase documents related exclusively to a particular responsibility center.
