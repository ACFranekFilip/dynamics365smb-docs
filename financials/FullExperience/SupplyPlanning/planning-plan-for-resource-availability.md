# Plan for Resource Availability
In connection with master planning, you must know the exact availability of resources that can execute the planned operations. Resource planning consist mainly of adjustment and recalculation of shop floor calendars, but may also involve resetting a machine center's capacity or preparing to subcontract operations.  
  
 Before you can plan for resource availability, the resources, such as machine and work centers, must be created and their calendars filled in with expected capacity. This is described in [Configure Production Processes](../configure-production-processes.md) as a task under Production.  
  
 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them. These tasks are listed in the order in which they are generally performed.  
  
|**To**|**See**|  
|------------|-------------|  
|Learn how to configure work shifts and use shop calendars to define production capacity.|[Shop Calendars](../shop-calendars.md)|  
|Lay out a calendar of capacity (time) in a work center based on configured shifts, work days, and holidays.|"Calculate a Work Center Calendar" in [Creating a Work Center Calendar](../how-to-create-work-center-calendars.md)|  
|Update the work center calendar with current absence information.|"Record Work Center Absence" in [Creating a Work Center Calendar](../how-to-create-work-center-calendars.md)|  
|Update and recalculate active shop calendars to reflect changes in capacity.|[How to: Update Calendar Entries for Work Centers](../how-to-update-calendar-entries-for-work-centers.md)|  
|Enable finite loading on a critical machine or work center, for example, because you have defined it as a bottleneck.|Capacity Constrained Resource|  
|Prepare subcontracted operations|[About Subcontracting](../about-subcontracting.md)|
