# Operations Planning
The production operations required to transform inputs into finished goods must be planned daily or weekly depending on the volume and nature of the products.  
  
 Microsoft Dynamics NAV offers features to supply for anticipated and actual demand from sale and production as well as features for distribution planning using stockkeeping units and location transfers.  
  
 Although a production order can be used to execute a [project sale of produced items](../OperationsPlanning/how-to-plan-project-orders.md), the planning of operations involved in a project may be better supported with the [Project Management](../Jobs/invoice-jobs.md) functionality.  
  
 Operations planning typically starts with resource planning, such as setting production capacities in the shop calendars and planning for potential subcontracting of production operations. Then you can perform master planning to manage sales demand and production demand for components.  
  
 The configuration needed to prepare production capacities, such as creating shop calendars, routings, and machine centers is described in [Configure Production Processes](../Production/configure-production-processes.md).  
  
 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them. These tasks are listed in the order in which they are generally performed.
