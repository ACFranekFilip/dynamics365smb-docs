# How to: Recalculate Calendar Entries for Machine Centers
You can update the calendar entries after making changes in the shop calendar. The existing calendar entries are verified to make sure they correspond to the shop calendar. The appropriate calendar entry is corrected if deviations are identified.  
  
### To recalculate calendar entries for a machine center  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Machine Centers**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Open the relevant machine center from the list.  
  
3.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Planning** group, choose **Calendar**.  
  
4.  In the **Work Center Calendar** window, choose **Show Matrix**.  
  
5.  In the **Work Center Calendar Matrix** window, select the calendar or calendars that you want to calculate.  
  
6.  On the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Recalculate**.  
  
7.  Set filters to define which calendar entries to recalculate, and then choose the **OK** button.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  The recalculation of calendar entries overwrites any manual changes made to the calendar entries.  
>   
>  Only existing calendar entries of the machine center are validated; therefore, the function cannot create new calendar entries.
