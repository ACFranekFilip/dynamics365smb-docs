# How to: Release Production Orders Automatically
With an automatic release, you can release several production orders at the same time.  
  
 Use this facility if several production orders are awaiting release and you do not intend to release them individually.  
  
### To release production orders automatically  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Change Production Order Status**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **Status Filter** field, select **Firm Planned** to filter the production orders to be released.  
  
3.  On the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Change Status**.  
  
4.  In the **New Status** field, the **Released** option is preselected as a default.  
  
5.  Choose the **Yes** button. The production orders are now released.
