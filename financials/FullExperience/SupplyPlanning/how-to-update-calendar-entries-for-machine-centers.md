# How to: Update Calendar Entries for Machine Centers
When you create a new machine center, its calendar entries do not yet exist. Calendar changes, such as absence, are not immediately visible either. When you have entered the machine centerâ€™s nonworking days, you must recalculate the calendar.  
  
### To update calendar entries for a machine center  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Machine Centers**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Open the relevant **Machine Center** card from the list.  
  
3.  On the  **Navigate** tab, in the **Planning** group, choose **Calendar**.  
  
4.  In the **Machine Center Calendar** window, on the **Actions** tab, in the **General** group, choose **Show Matrix**.  
  
5.  In the **Machine Center Calendar Matrix** window, on the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** window, choose **Calculate**.  
  
6.  On the **Machine Center** FastTab, select the machine centers to be recalculated by setting a filter.  
  
7.  Fill in the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields for which the calendar entries are to be calculated.  
  
8.  Choose the **OK** button to calculate the calendar entries for the selected period.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  The calculation of calendar entries overwrites any manual changes made to the calendar entries.
