# Shop Calendars
The shop calendars refer to work shifts. They are a classification tool to group working times. The work shifts must be set up before the shop calendars can be created.  
  
 The availability and efficiency can be evaluated and displayed separately, according to work shifts for the capacity.  
  
## Use of Shop Calendars  
 The shop calendar is used for presetting the availability of capacities. This presetting is done in different stages and is systematically refined until the final calendar results in the correct capacity.  
  
 A rough setting of the working time is made. This rough setting is only used in the calculation of a replenishment plan. The rough calendar is the basis for rough planning.  
  
 The machine center and work center refer to a calendar. Here other calendar absences can be planned, which deviate from the settings in the shop calendar and enable further specification.  
  
 From these presettings, an exact calendar is calculated for the capacities, which then forms the basis for fine scheduling of the capacity planning.  
  
 The individual calendar of the capacities is the basis for the available working time in the efficiency lists.
