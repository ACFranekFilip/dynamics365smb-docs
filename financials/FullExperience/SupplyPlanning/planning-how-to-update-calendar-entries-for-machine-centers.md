# How to: Update Calendar Entries for Machine Centers
When you create a new machine center, its calendar entries do not yet exist. Calendar changes, such as absence, are not immediately visible either. When you have entered the machine center’s nonworking days, you must recalculate the calendar.  
  
### To update calendar entries for a machine center  
  
1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Machine Centers**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Open the relevant **Machine Center** card from the list.  
  
3.  On the  **Navigate** tab, in the **Planning** group, choose **Calendar**.  
  
4.  In the **Machine Center Calendar** window, on the **Actions** tab, in the **General** group, choose **Show Matrix**.  
  
5.  In the **Machine Center Calendar Matrix** window, on the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** window, choose **Calculate**.  
  
6.  On the **Machine Center** FastTab, select the machine centers to be recalculated by setting a filter.  
  
7.  Fill in the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields for which the calendar entries are to be calculated.  
  
8.  Choose the **OK** button to calculate the calendar entries for the selected period.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  The calculation of calendar entries overwrites any manual changes made to the calendar entries.
