# Perform Master Planning
Before a detailed executable plan ( [see MRP](../plan-for-resource-availability.md) and the final-assembly production schedule, that is expected production orders for demanded end items.  
  
 In [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)], the Calculate MPS option (Master Production Schedule) is the system expression of the above master planning activities.  
  
 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them. These tasks are listed in the order in which they are generally performed.
