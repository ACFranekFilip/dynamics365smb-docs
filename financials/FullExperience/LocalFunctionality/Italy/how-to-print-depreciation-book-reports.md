# How to: Print Depreciation Book Reports
The **Depreciation Book** is a fiscal report that is sorted by year and item class. The **Depreciation Book** report shows changes in fixed asset stock in a given year by item class, rather than by the individual items. The **Depreciation Book** report is run after the depreciation method has been set up and assets have been entered.

1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Under **Reports and Analysis**, in the **Reports** section, choose **Depreciation Book**.  
  
3.  Expand the **Options** FastTab.
