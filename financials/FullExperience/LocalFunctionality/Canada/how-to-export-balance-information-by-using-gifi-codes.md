# How to: Export Balance Information by Using GIFI Codes
You can export balance information using General Index of Financial Information \(GIFI\) codes and save the exported file in a Microsoft Excel workbook. You can modify, save, or delete the file. You can use the file to transfer information to your tax preparation software.  
  
### To export balance information using GIFI codes  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Export GIFI Info. to Excel**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **Export GIFI Info. to Excel** window, on the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  
  
    |ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[bp_tablefield](../../ApplicationDesign/includes/bp_tablefield_md.md)]-->|ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[bp_tabledescription](../../ApplicationDesign/includes/bp_tabledescription_md.md)]-->|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**\($ B\_10005\_F\_1\_1020000 Balance As of Date $\)**|The balance as of the specified date.|  
    |**\($ B\_10005\_F\_1\_1020006 Use Add. Rpt. Currency $\)**|Select to display the amounts in additional reporting currency.|  
    |**\($ B\_10005\_F\_1\_1020004 Include GIFI Name $\)**|Select to include the GIFI name in the file.|  
    |**\($ B\_10005\_F\_1\_1020002 Include Unused Codes $\)**|Select to include the unused codes in the file.|  
  
3.  On the **G\/L Account** FastTab, select the appropriate filters.  
  
4.  To export the file to Excel, choose the **OK** button.  
  
     In the Excel file, the balance is rounded to the nearest percentage, but the cell value maintains the same percentage as it does in the general ledger.
