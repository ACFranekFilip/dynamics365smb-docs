# Electronic Payments for United States, Canada, and Mexico
FIX INCLUDE HERE<!--[!INCLUDE[nav_current_short](../../BusinessFunctionality/IntegratingWithMicrosoftOffice/includes/nav_current_short_md.md)] --> allows you to pay vendors or send refunds to customers using electronic payments, rather than by printing paper checks. Electronic payments are exported into a standard National Automated Clearing House Association \(NACHA\) file format used by most banks in the United States, or into the format used by the Royal Bank of Canada. This file is then transmitted to your bank and processed.  
  
 Before you can transfer payments electronically to a vendor, you must set up a bank account for the vendor. You must also set up the electronic payment links with your bank and set up the **Bank Account Card** for your own bank to handle electronic payments. Your bank will provide the transmission program.
