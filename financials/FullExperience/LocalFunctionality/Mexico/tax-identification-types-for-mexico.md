# Tax Identification Types for Mexico
All customers and vendors must a have federal tax identification number. The identification type used for a customer or vendor depends on whether the customer or vendor is classified as a company or as a person.  
  
## Available Tax Identification Types  
 In Mexico, a legal entity, such as a company or a person, is assigned a tax identification number according to two types.  
  
 Registro Federal de Contribuyentes \(RFC\)  
 This tax identification type can be applied to companies and to people. An RFC number for a company is 12 characters, while an RFC number for a person is 13 characters.  
  
 Cédula de identification fiscal con clave única de registro de población \(CURP\)  
 This tax identification type can only be applied to people. A CURP number is 18 characters.  
  
 When you create a new customer or vendor in FIX INCLUDE HERE<!--[!INCLUDE[navnow](../../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)] -->, you specify whether the customer or vendor is a company or a person, and then you specify the tax identification type. The tax identification type and the tax identification number are included in any reports that reference tax information about a customer or vendor.
