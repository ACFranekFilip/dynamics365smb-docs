# VAT-VIES Declaration in Finland
[!INCLUDE[nav_current_short](../../BusinessFunctionality/IntegratingWithMicrosoftOffice/includes/nav_current_short_md.md)] provides Finnish enhancements to comply with regulations for VAT and European Union \(EU\) sales reporting. The **VAT\-VIES Declaration Tax Auth** report and the **EC Sales List** report include the **EU Service** field, which allows you to print service\-related sales amounts separately from item\-related sales amounts based on different posting groups. This information is required in VAT reports for EU third\-party trade transactions in 2010 and all subsequent years.
