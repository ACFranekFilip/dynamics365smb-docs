# SEPA Credit Transfer Payments
[!INCLUDE[nav_current_short](../../BusinessFunctionality/IntegratingWithMicrosoftOffice/includes/nav_current_short_md.md)] includes Finnish enhancements to allow you to create Single Euro Payments Area \(SEPA\) credit transfer files to send vendor payments to banks. A SEPA credit transfer is a payment that is transferred according to the file format specified by the European Payments Commission.
