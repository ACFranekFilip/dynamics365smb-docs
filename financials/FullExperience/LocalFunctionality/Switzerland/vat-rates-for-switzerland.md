# VAT Rates for Switzerland
If VAT rates change, you must use the VAT rate change tool. In earlier versions of FIX INCLUDE HERE<!--[!INCLUDE[navnow](../../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)] --> you could temporarily use both the old and the new VAT rates for transactions, depending on the shipping dates. This functionality has been deprecated.  
  
 For more information, see [Perform VAT Rate Conversions](../../Finance/perform-vat-rate-conversions.md).
