# How to: Set Up Automatic Archiving of Documents in Switzerland
You can set up automatic archiving of sales documents and purchase documents—such as quotes, blanket orders, and orders—before you delete documents.  
  
 The following procedure describes how to set up automatic archiving of sales documents, but the same steps apply to purchase documents.  
  
### To set up automatic archiving of documents  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  On the **Sales & Receivables Setup** window, on the **Archiving** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.

    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Archiving Sales Quote**|**Never** to never archive sales quotes when they are deleted.<br /><br /> –or–<br /><br /> **Question** to prompt the user to choose whether to archive sales quotes when they are deleted.<br /><br /> –or–<br /><br /> **Always** to archive sales quotes automatically when they are deleted.|
