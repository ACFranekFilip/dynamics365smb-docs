# How to: Print Sales and Purchase Invoice Books
The **Sales Invoice Book** report and **Purchases Invoice Book** report allow you to check all of the sales and purchase documents created for a specific period.  
  
 Invoices posted from a journal are displayed in these reports. When a sales or purchase general posting journal line is posted, the VAT entry that is created stores information about the customer or vendor.  
  
 You can print the **Sales Invoice Book** report and **Purchases Invoice Book** report in additional reporting currency. You can also filter these reports to get a list of the following:
