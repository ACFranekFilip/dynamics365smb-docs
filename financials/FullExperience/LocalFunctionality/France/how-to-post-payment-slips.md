# How to: Post Payment Slips
You must post payment slips to complete a payment transaction and to create the related financial data. You can post a payment slip if the payment slip's **Action Type** is set to **Ledger**.

 Before you post a payment slip, you must create the payment slip. For more information, see [How to: Create Payment Slips](../../LocalFunctionalityForMicrosoftDynamicsNav2016/France/how-to-create-payment-slips.md).
