# Standard Purchase Codes
For some vendors, companies receive purchase invoices with similar information. Often these documents contain one single invoice line, which is practically always to be posted on the same account, and which contains the same amount. For example; the rent for the company building.  
  
 In order to facilitate purchase document entry, the standard purchase codes have been introduced in Microsoft Dynamics NAV. Standard purchase codes allow you to setup purchase lines to be used regularly. You can setup any number of standard purchase codes, and each of them can consist of any number of standard purchase lines.  
  
 You can let the program insert standard purchase lines in different ways. You can specify this in the field Insert Std. Vend. Purch. Lines on the [\($ N\_460 Purchases & Payables Setup $\)](../../LocalFunctionalityForMicrosoftDynamicsNav2016/Netherlands/-$-n_460-purchases-payables-setup-window-$-.md) window.  
  
 Depending on the method you have selected in the field Insert Std. Vend. Purch. Lines, you have the possibility to decide on which purchase window you want to activate this functionality. Place a check mark in the fields Quotes, Orders, Invoices and Credit Memos on the Purchases & Payables Setup window, if you want to insert standard purchase lines on respectively purchase quotes, purchase orders, purchase invoices or purchase credit memos.
