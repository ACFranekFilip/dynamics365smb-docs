# How to: Set Up Vendors Without ABN for Calculating the Withholding Tax
Withholding Tax \(WHT\) is calculated for local vendors who do not have an Australian Business Number \(ABN\), as required by tax law.  
  
### To set up vendors without ABN for calculating the withholding tax  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Choose the required vendor, and then, on the **Home** tab, choose **Edit**.  
  
3.  In the **Vendor Card** window, on the **Registration** FastTab, the **ABN** field and **Foreign Vend** field must be empty.  
  
4.  Choose the **OK** button.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The WHT percentage is automatically withheld in accordance with what was specified in the **WHT Posting Setup** window. The WHT certificate is produced for submission to the vendor.
