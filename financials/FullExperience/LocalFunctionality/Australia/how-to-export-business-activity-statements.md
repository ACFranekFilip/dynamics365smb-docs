# How to: Export Business Activity Statements
A Business Activity Statement \(BAS\) is a form that reports both the total Goods and Services Tax \(GST\) collected from sales activities, and GST paid on purchases.  
  
 You can review the calculated GST amounts, export the BAS setup details to Excel for manual adjustments, and print BAS.  
  
### To export business activity statements  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **BAS Setup Names**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select a relevant BAS calculation sheet.  
  
3.  On the **Home** tab, in the **Process** group, choose **BAS Setup** to open the **BAS Setup** window.  
  
4.  On the **Home** tab, in the **Process** group, choose **Preview** to open the **BAS Setup Preview** window.  
  
5.  In the **BAS Setup** window, to export the BAS setup details to Excel, on the **Home** tab, choose **Export to Excel**.  
  
6.  In the **Export BAS Setup to Excel** batch job, select the appropriate filters, and then choose the **OK** button.  
  
7.  Close the **BAS Setup Preview** and **BAS Setup** windows.  
  
### To print business activity statements  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **BAS Calculation Sheets**, and then choose the related link.
