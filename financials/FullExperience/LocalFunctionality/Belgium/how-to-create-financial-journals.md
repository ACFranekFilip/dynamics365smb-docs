# How to: Create Financial Journals
Financial journals are used to register bank account transactions. The financial journal lets you enter a starting balance and an ending balance and automatically calculate the difference so that you can verify that all of the transactions have been registered.  
  
### To create a financial journal  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  On the **Home** tab, in the **New** Group, choose **New**.  
  
3.  Fill in the fields as described in the following table.
