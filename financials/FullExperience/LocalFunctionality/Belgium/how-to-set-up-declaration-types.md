# How to: Set Up Declaration Types
In FIX INCLUDE HERE<!--[!INCLUDE[navnow](../../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)] -->, there are two types of declaration:  
  
-   Simplified declaration  
  
-   Extended declaration  
  
 The type of declaration depends on the amount of shipped or received goods. To determine the type of declaration that you should use, see the [National Bank of Belgium](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=163064) web site.  
  
 When using the extended declaration, you will also need to set up an Incoterm in Intrastat Declaration for each shipping method. For more information, see [Incoterm in Intrastat Decl. Field](ms-its:be_lf_a.chm::/T_10_11300.htm).  
  
### To set up declaration types  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  On the **General** FastTab, select the **Simplified Intrastat Decl.** check box to set up a simplified declaration type. Clear this field to use extended declaration.  
  
3.  Choose the **OK** button.
