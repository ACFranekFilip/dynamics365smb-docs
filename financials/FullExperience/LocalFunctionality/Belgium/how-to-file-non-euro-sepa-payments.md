# How to: File Non-Euro SEPA Payments
In FIX INCLUDE HERE<!--[!INCLUDE[navnow](../../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)] -->, you can file non\-euro SEPA payments with the bank. This is useful when you make payments to other countries that do not use SEPA and for currencies other than the euro.  
  
 Before you can file a non\-euro SEPA payment you must complete the following administration tasks:  
  
-   Set up a new export protocol for a non\-euro SEPA. For more information, see Export Protocol.  
  
-   In the **Country\/Region** table, clear the **SEPA Allowed** field for each country that belongs to the EEA zone.  
  
-   Verify that the **Currency Euro** field in the **General Ledger Setup** table is not in euro currency.  
  
-   Verify that the vendorâ€™s **Preferred Bank Account** field in the **Vendor** table contains the IBAN and SWIFT code.
