# How to: Export Remittance Payments
You can use the export remittance payments process to export the payments file to your computer. You can then transfer the remittance payments to the bank.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Before you can export a remittance payment, you must select a payment format in the **Payment Export Format** field in the **Bank Account Card** window.  
  
 You export payments to a bank file by choosing the **Export Payments** button in the **Payment Journal** window. The process may be different, depending on the export format that you select:  
  
-   Payments using the SEPA payment standard are directly exported to a file when you choose the **Export Payments** button. For more information, see [How to: Export Payments to a Bank File](../../BusinessFunctionality/DataExchange/how-to-export-payments-to-a-bank-file.md).  
  
-   Payments using local payment standards, such as **Telepay**, are exported with either the **Remittance \- export \(bank\)** or the **Remittance \- export \(BBS\)** report, which automatically opens when you choose the **Export Payments** button.  
  
 The procedure for exporting payments using the **Remittance â€“ Export** batch job is described in this topic.
