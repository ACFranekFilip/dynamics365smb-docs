# How to: Calculate Proportional VAT
You can use proportional VAT to calculate VAT when there is both deductible and non\-deductible VAT. Because it is difficult to know where and how an item is used, you will have to contact the Norwegian tax authorities to determine whether a specified percentage of the VAT is deductible based on historical data.  
  
### To calculate proportional VAT  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **VAT Posting Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **VAT Posting Setup** window, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  
  
    |[!INCLUDE[bp_tablefield](../../ApplicationDesign/includes/bp_tablefield_md.md)]|[!INCLUDE[bp_tabledescription](../../ApplicationDesign/includes/bp_tabledescription_md.md)]|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Calc. Prop. Deduction VAT**|Select to indicate that you want to use the proportional VAT percentage. **Important:**  This field is available in the **VAT Posting Setup** window, but it is not shown by default. [!INCLUDE[bp_customize](../../Finance/includes/bp_customize_md.md)]|  
    |**\($ T\_325\_10605 Proportional Deduction VAT % $\)**|Enter the percentage of VAT to deduct.|  
  
3.  Choose the **OK** button.
