# How to: Set Up Recurring Orders
After you create a recurring group, you can set up recurring orders on the blanket sales order by adding the group to the order. For more information, see [How to: Create Blanket Sales Orders](../../Sales/how-to-create-blanket-sales-orders.md) and [How to: Set Up Recurring Groups](../../LocalFunctionalityForMicrosoftDynamicsNav2016/Norway/how-to-set-up-recurring-groups.md).  
  
### To set up a recurring order  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Blanket Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  On the **Home** tab, in the **New** group, choose **New**.  
  
3.  On the **General** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  
  
    |ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[bp_tablefield](../../ApplicationDesign/includes/bp_tablefield_md.md)]-->|ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[bp_tabledescription](../../ApplicationDesign/includes/bp_tabledescription_md.md)]-->|
