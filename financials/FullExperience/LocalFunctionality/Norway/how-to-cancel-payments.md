# How to: Cancel Payments
FIX INCLUDE HERE<!--[!INCLUDE[navnow](../../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)] --> includes Norwegian enhancements that allow you to cancel payments. If the payment has been sent to the bank, the bank must be contacted to cancel the remittance that they received.  
  
-   A payment order can be canceled if the payments are not received by the bank and a new remittance must be made. You can also cancel a payment order if you do not want to transfer the payments to the bank, for example if the payments are incorrect. Only open payment orders can be canceled.  
  
-   An individual payment can be canceled if the payment cannot be processed by the bank and a new remittance has to be made. You can also cancel a payment if you do not want to process the payment. Settled payments cannot be canceled.
