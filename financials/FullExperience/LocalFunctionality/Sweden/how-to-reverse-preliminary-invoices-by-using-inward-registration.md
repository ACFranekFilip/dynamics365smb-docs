# How to: Reverse Preliminary Invoices by Using Inward Registration
Reverse an inward registration if you want to cancel it, for example, because you do not need the preliminary purchase invoice. For more information, see Inward Registration.  
  
### To reverse a preliminary invoice  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select an invoice that has been posted using inward registration.  
  
3.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Invoice** group, choose **Inward Registration**.  
  
4.  On the **Actions** tab, choose **Edit** to open the **Inward Registration** window.  
  
5.  On the **Actions** tab, in the **Posting** group, and then choose **Reverse**.  
  
6.  Choose **Yes** to confirm that you want to reverse the inward registration.  
  
     The inward registration has been reversed and deleted. You can see the resulting negative entry in the **Inward Reg. Entry** window.  
  
 For information about creating a new inward registration, see [How to: Post Preliminary Invoices by Using Inward Registration](../../LocalFunctionalityForMicrosoftDynamicsNav2016/Sweden/how-to-post-preliminary-invoices-by-using-inward-registration.md).
