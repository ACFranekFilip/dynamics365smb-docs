# How to: Set Up Multiple Interest Rates
You can calculate finance charges with multiple interest rates for a specific period. The interest calculation is similar for all financial charges, with variation only in the rate of interest for a specific period.  
  
 For example, you can charge customers accordingly if they pay late.  
  
### To set up multiple interest rates  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Finance Charge Terms**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **Finance Charge Terms** window, select the required finance term, and then, on the **Navigate** tab, choose **Interest Rates**.  
  
3.  Fill in the fields as described in the following table.  
  
    |[!INCLUDE[bp_tablefield](../../ApplicationDesign/includes/bp_tablefield_md.md)]|[!INCLUDE[bp_tabledescription](../../ApplicationDesign/includes/bp_tabledescription_md.md)]|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Start Date**|Enter the start date for each finance charge interest rate code.|  
    |**Interest Rate**|Enter the percentage that must be used to calculate interest.|  
    |**Interest Period \(Days\)**|Enter the period for each finance charge interest rate.|  
  
4.  Choose the **OK** button.  
  
5.  In the **Search** box, enter **Reminder Terms**, and then choose the related link.  
  
6.  In the **Reminder Terms** window, select the required reminder term, and then, on the **Actions** tab, choose **Levels**.  
  
7.  In the **Reminder Levels** window, select the **Calculate Interest** field.  
  
 When you issue a finance charge memo, the memo shows the finance charges with multiple interest rates for a specific time period. The memo also contains the contact details of the customer, the company issuing the memo, the additional amount, and the total amount. The opening entry on the memo is displayed in bold. The finance charges are calculated with multiple interest rates for a specific time period and are printed after the opening entry of the memo.
