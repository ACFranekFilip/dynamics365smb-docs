# How to: Set Up EU Third-Party Purchase Transactions
European Union \(EU\) third-party trade occurs when you receive a purchase invoice from a customer in one EU country\/region and the products are sent to a different EU country\/region without entering Sweden. The transaction amount must be identified and reported separately to comply with Swedish VAT reporting and VAT Information Exchange System \(VIES\) requirements. ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[nav_current_short](../../BusinessFunctionality/IntegratingWithMicrosoftOffice/includes/nav_current_short_md.md)]--> includes Swedish enhancements that allow purchase transactions to be set up as EU third-party trade. Posted EU third-party transactions can then be filtered in VAT statements and excluded from the amount in the **Sales to Customer** column in the **VAT- VIES Declaration Tax Auth** report.  
  
### To set up EU third-party purchase transactions  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  On the **Actions** tab, choose **New**.  
  
3.  On the **Foreign Trade** FastTab, select **EU 3-Party Trade**.  
  
4.  Choose the **OK** button.
