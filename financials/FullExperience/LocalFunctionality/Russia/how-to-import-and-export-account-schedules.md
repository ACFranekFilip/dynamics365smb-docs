# How to: Import and Export Account Schedules
FIX INCLUDE HERE<!--[!INCLUDE[navnow](../../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)] --> enables you to import and export account schedules into other companies and databases.  
  
### To import and export account schedules  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Account Schedule Names** or **Account Schedules**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **Account Schedule Names**or **Account Schedules** window, on the **Home** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Import Settings** or **Export Settings**. An extensible markup language \(XML\) file will be created for the import or export.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  When you import account schedules, all existing records with primary key values that are equal to imported values will be deleted.
