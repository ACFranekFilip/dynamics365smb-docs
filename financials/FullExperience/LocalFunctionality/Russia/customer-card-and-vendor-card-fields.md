# Customer Card and Vendor Card Fields
The **Customer Card** and **Vendor Card** windows include several additional fields. The **Default Bank Code** field has been added to the **Payments** FastTab on both cards, and the following fields have been added to the **Invoicing** FastTab on the **Vendor Card** form:  
  
-   **KPP Code**  
  
-   **OKPO Code**  
  
-   **OKONX Code**  
  
 Every company uses these codes, and they must be shown in required documents such as payment documents and factura\-invoices.  
  
-   The **KPP Code** field is for the code of the company registration.  
  
-   The **OKPO Code** field is for the Classification of Enterprises and Organizations code.  
  
-   The **OKONX Code** field is for a federation\-wide classifier of a sector of the national economy.  
  
 The KPP code has also been added to the **Payments** FastTab of the **Customer Card** form.  
  
 Each customer can specify several bank accounts in the **Customer Bank Account** form, but there is usually one default bank account for most of a customer's payments. This most widely used bank account can be selected in the **Default Bank Code** field. The same applies for vendors.  
  
 The **Default Bank Code** field is added to the **Payments** FastTab of the customer card and the vendor card.
