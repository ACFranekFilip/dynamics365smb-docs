# How to: Define an Account Schedule Extension
[!INCLUDE[navnow](../../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)] enables you to define an extension for an account schedule line. Extensions are useful if you want to filter the data of your general ledger accounts.  
  
### To define an account schedule extension  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Account Schedule**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **\($ N\_104\_18 Name $\)** field, select the account schedule for which you want to define an extension.  
  
3.  In the **\($ T\_85\_3 Row No. $\)** field, select the number of the account schedule row for which you want to define an extension.  
  
4.  In the **\($ T\_85\_6 Totaling Type $\)** field, select **Custom**, and then select the table that you want to use from the **\($ T\_85\_12404 Extension Source Table $\)** field.  
  
     Based on your selections, the account schedule information is filtered from the entry tables, and then new amounts are calculated for the specified account schedule line.
