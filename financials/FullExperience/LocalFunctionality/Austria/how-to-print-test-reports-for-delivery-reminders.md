# How to: Print Test Reports for Delivery Reminders
After you have created delivery reminders and made any needed modifications, you can either print the test reports or issue the delivery reminders.  
  
 A test report is a document that lets you review and modify a delivery reminder before you issue it.  
  
### To print test reports before issuing delivery reminders  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Delivery Reminder**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **Delivery Reminder List** window, on the **Report** tab, choose **Delivery Reminder \- Test**.  
  
3.  In the **Delivery Reminder \- Test** window, set a filter if you want to print only selected delivery reminders.  
  
4.  Choose the **Print** to print the report or choose the **Preview** button to view it on the screen.
