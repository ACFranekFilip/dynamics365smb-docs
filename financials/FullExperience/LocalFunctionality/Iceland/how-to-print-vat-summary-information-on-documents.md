# How to: Print VAT Summary Information on Documents
If VAT is calculated, VAT summary information is typically printed on sales and purchase documents. However, in Iceland, ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[navnow](../../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)]--> does not print VAT summary information if only one VAT sales code is used in the document. You can modify this behavior by using the **Always Show VAT Summary** option.  
  
 The following procedure describes how to display VAT summary information on a sales invoice document, but the same steps also apply to sales order confirmations, sales quotes, sales credit memos, blanket sales orders, purchase orders, purchase invoices, and purchase credit memos.  
  
### To show VAT summary information  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Posted Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the list, select the relevant document, and on the **Actions** tab, choose **Print**.  
  
3.  To display VAT information in the report, select the **Always Show VAT Summary** check box.
