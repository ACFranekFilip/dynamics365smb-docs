# How to: Replace Reminder Text
There are several ways you can determine the text that appears on the printed reminder.  
  
 In some cases, you may want to replace the beginning and ending texts that have been defined for the current level with those from a different level.  
  
### To replace reminder texts  
  
1.  On the reminder, on the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Update Reminder Text**. The **Update Reminder Text** window opens.  
  
2.  On the **Options** FastTab, in the **Reminder Level** field, enter the required level.  
  
3.  Choose the **OK** button to update the beginning and ending texts.
