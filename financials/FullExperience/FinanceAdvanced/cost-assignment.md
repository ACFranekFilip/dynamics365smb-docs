# Cost Assignment
An Item Charge gives you the possibility to include the value of additional cost components into the unit cost or unit price of an item. Such cost or price components can, for example, be freight, insurance or other costs related to the item.  
  
 The item charge can be used:  
  
-   To identify the landed cost of an item for making more accurate decisions on how to optimize the distribution network.  
  
-   For breaking down the unit cost \/ unit price of an item for analysis purposes.  
  
-   To include purchase allowances into the unit cost and sales allowances into the unit price.
