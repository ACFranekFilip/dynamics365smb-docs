# How to: Search for Specific Documents
You can choose the **Navigate** function from ledger entry windows and windows containing posted shipments and receipts. You can use it to find all entries posted with the same date or document number. The document number may be either a number assigned in a general journal or the number of an invoice or credit memo.  
  
### To search for specific documents  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **\($ N\_16 Chart of Accounts $\)** window, select the account to which the document you are looking for was posted.  
  
3.  Choose the **Balance** field to see a list of the ledger entries that make up the balance.  
  
4.  Select the line with the ledger entry you want to investigate.  
  
5.  On the **Actions**, in the **Process** group, choose **Navigate**. [!INCLUDE[navnow](../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)] counts the records, and then the **Navigate** window appears. This window displays a list of the types of entries found and the number of each type.  
  
6.  Choose the desired type, **G\/L Entry**. On the **Home** tab, in the **Process** group, choose **Show** to see the individual entries. The **\($ N\_20 General Ledger Entries $\)** window appears. It displays only the entries with the date and document number shown in the **Navigate** window. By choosing the other entry types, you can see corresponding lists.
