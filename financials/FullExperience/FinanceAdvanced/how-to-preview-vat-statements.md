# How to: Preview VAT Statements
After you have defined a VAT statement, you can see a preview of it on the screen.  
  
### To preview VAT statements  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **VAT Statement**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **\($ N\_317 VAT Statement $\)** window, on the **Navigate** tab, in the **VAT Statement** group, choose **Preview**.  
  
3.  Enter a date filter to limit the statement to a specific period. For more information about how to customize the page to show the date filter, see [How to: Set Filters](../WorkingWithDynamics/how-to-set-filters.md).  
  
4.  You can select various options to specify the type of VAT entries that are to be included in the statement.  
  
5.  On the lines where the **Type** field contains **VAT Entry Totaling**, you can see a list of VAT entries by choosing the amount in the **Column Amount** field.
