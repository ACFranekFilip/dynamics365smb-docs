# How to: View Documents from One Responsibility Center
You can set up users so that in their daily routines the program retrieves only the documents relevant for their particular work areas. Users are usually associated with one responsibility center and work only with documents related to specific application areas at that particular center.  
  
 To set this up, you assign responsibility centers to users in three basic functional areas: Purchase & Payables, Sales & Receivables and Service Management.  
  
### To assign responsibility centers to users  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **User Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **User Setup** window, select the user you want to assign a responsibility center to. If the user not is on the list, you must enter a user ID in the **User ID** field.  
  
3.  In the **Sales Resp. Ctr. Filter** field, enter the responsibility center where the user will have tasks related to Sales & Receivables.  
  
4.  In the **Purchase Resp. Ctr. Filter** field, enter the responsibility center where the user will have tasks related to Purchase & Payables.  
  
5.  In the **Service Resp. Ctr. Filter** field, enter the responsibility center where the user will have tasks related to Service Management.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Users will still be able to view all posted documents and ledger entries, not just those related to their own responsibility center.
