# How to: Record Manual Expenses
You can record manual expenses.  
  
 Manual expenses are items such as salaries, interest on credit, or planned investments.  
  
 To repeatedly record similar or identical manual expenses, you can use the functions that are integrated in the cash flow forecast to record the recurring amounts.  
  
 The following procedure describes how to record an extra investment of 1,000.00 LCY on April 10, 2013. This is a manual expense.  
  
### To record manual expenses  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Cash Flow Manual Expenses**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  On the **Home** tab, in the **New** group, choose **New**.  
  
3.  In the **Code** field, enter a code for the manual expense. This step is required.  
  
4.  In the **Cash Flow Account No.** field, enter the account number to which the investment is recorded.  
  
5.  In the **Starting Date** field, enter **April 10, 2013**.  
  
6.  In the **Ending Date** field, enter **April 10, 2013**.  
  
7.  Leave the **Recurring Frequency** field blank because this expense occurs only once.  
  
8.  In the **Amount** field, enter **1,000.00**.  
  
9. Choose the **OK** button to close the window.
