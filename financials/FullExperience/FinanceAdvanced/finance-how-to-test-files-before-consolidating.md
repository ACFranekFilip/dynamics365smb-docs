# How to: Test Files Before Consolidating
After you have set up the consolidated company and the business units, and you have exported the necessary data, you are ready to do the consolidation. This means you can transfer the figures from the business units to the consolidated company.  
  
 Before you do so, it is a good idea to check whether there are differences between the basic information in the business units and in the consolidated company. There are two reports for this purpose: one for testing a database and one for testing a file.  
  
 For more information, see [How to: Test Databases Before Consolidating](../how-to-test-databases-before-consolidating.md).  
  
### To test files before consolidating  
  
1.  Open the consolidated company. For more information, see [\($ S\_COMPANY How to: Select a Company $\)](../-$-s_company-how-to-select-a-company-$-.md)  
  
2.  In the **Search** box, enter **Business Units**, and then choose the related link.Open the ![Shortcut icon](../media/shortcutcoldicon.gif "shortcutColdIcon")**Business Units** window.  
  
3.  In the **Business Units** window, on the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Test File**.  
  
4.  Enter the name of the file to be tested, and then choose **Print**.  
  
 The report is similar to the Test Database report.
