# How to: Set Up VAT Business Posting Groups
Before setting up VAT business posting groups, you must decide how many different groups you need. This depends on a number of factors, including local legislation and whether you trade both domestically and internationally.  
  
### To set up VAT business posting groups  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **VAT Business Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **VAT Business Posting Groups** window, enter a code to identify the group in the **Code** field.  
  
3.  In the **Description** field, enter a brief description of the group.  
  
 Repeat this procedure for each VAT business posting group you want to set up.
