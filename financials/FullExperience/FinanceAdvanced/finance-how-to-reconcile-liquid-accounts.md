# How to: Reconcile Liquid Accounts
For each account included in a reconciliation, the net sum of all amounts on the account is calculated in the general journal. Before a general ledger account can be reconciled, you must select the **Reconciliation Account** field on the account card.  
  
### To reconcile liquid accounts  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **General Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Fill in at least one journal line with an account number, an amount, and an account number in the **Balancing Acc. No.** field.  
  
3.  On the **Actions** tab, in the **Posting** group, choose **Reconcile**.  
  
4.  To post the journal, open the **General Journal** window, and on the **Actions** tab, in the **Posting** group, choose **Post**.  
  
> [!TIP]  
>  If you print a test report before posting, a reconciliation appears at the end of the report.
