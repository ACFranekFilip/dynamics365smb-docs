# How to: Set Up Default VAT Business Posting Groups
You set up default VAT business posting groups by linking them to general business posting groups. [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)] automatically inserts the relevant code as the VAT business posting group when you assign the relevant business posting group to a customer, vendor, or general ledger account. Before you can do this, you must set up VAT business posting groups.  
  
### To set up default VAT business posting groups  
  
1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Gen. Business Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the relevant business posting group. On the **Home** tab, choose **Edit**.  
  
3.  In the **Def. VAT Bus. Posting Group** field, select the code that you want to use as default.  
  
4.  Select the **Auto Insert Default** check box.  
  
 If it is not relevant or you do not want to use this feature for either individual or all general business posting group codes, leave the two fields blank. Then you must manually assign VAT business posting groups to customers, vendors, and general ledger accounts.
