# How to: Set Up Shortcut Dimensions
You can choose up to eight dimensions whose values that you can enter directly on journals or sales\/purchase lines. These are called shortcut dimensions.  
  
### To set up shortcut dimensions  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **General Ledger Setup** window, on the **Dimensions** FastTab, in the **Shortcut Dimension 3 Code** field, enter the code for a dimension.  
  
3.  Repeat the procedure for **Shortcut Dimension 4\-8 Code** fields.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The **Shortcut Dimension 1 Code** and **Shortcut Dimension 2 Code** are the same as the **Global Dimension 1 Code** and **Global Dimension 2 Code**. These fields are already filled in.  
  
> [!TIP]  
>  The dimensions that you choose for shortcut dimensions should be the dimensions you most often enter manually.
