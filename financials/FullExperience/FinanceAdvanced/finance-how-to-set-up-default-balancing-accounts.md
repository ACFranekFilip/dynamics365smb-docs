# How to: Set Up Default Balancing Accounts
You can set up a default balancing account for each journal batch and have ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[navnow](../../includes/navnow_md.md)]--> automatically suggest a balancing account type and balancing account number on each journal line. If you do not specify a default balancing account, you must fill in the fields manually.  
  
### To set up default balancing accounts  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **General Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **General Journal** window, in the **Batch Name** field, select the journal batch for which you want to set up a default balancing account.  
  
3.  In the **Bal. Account Type** field, select the account type that you want to use as the default balancing account type.  
  
4.  In the **Bal. Account No.** field, select the default balancing account number.  
  
 A default balancing account is useful for journal batches, in which you enter the same balancing account on each line.  
  
 If you want to use a balancing account different from the default account, you can manually change the balancing account type and balancing account number on the journal line.
