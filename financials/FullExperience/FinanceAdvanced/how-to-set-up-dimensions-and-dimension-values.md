# How to: Set Up Dimensions and Dimension Values
Before you set up dimensions, you should determine what financial information must be generated and what dimensions must be placed on general ledger entries.  
  
 You set up Dimensions in the ![Shortcut icon](../BusinessFunctionality/OnlineMaps/media/shortcutcoldicon.gif "shortcutColdIcon")**Dimensions** window. After you set up the dimensions, you must set up values for each dimension. As in the chart of accounts, you set up dimension values in hierarchies with totaling fields and indentation.  
  
### To set up dimension values  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Dimensions**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **Dimensions** window, select the line with the dimension for which you want to set up values. On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Dimension** group, choose **Dimension Values**.  
  
3.  Fill in a line for each dimension value you want to set up. You can set up any number of dimension values. For Help about a specific field, choose the field and press F1.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  If you want to set up a hierarchy you must make sure that the codes are in alphabetical order. This includes the codes of the dimension values that are standard.
