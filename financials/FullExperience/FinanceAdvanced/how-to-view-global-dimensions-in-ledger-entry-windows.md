# How to: View Global Dimensions in Ledger Entry Windows
Note that global dimensions are always company\-defined and company\-named. To see the global dimensions for your company, open the ![Shortcut icon](../BusinessFunctionality/OnlineMaps/media/shortcutcoldicon.gif "shortcutColdIcon")**General Ledger Setup** window.  
  
 In a ledger entry window, you can see whether there are global dimensions for the entries. The two global dimensions differ from the rest of your dimensions because you can use them as filters anywhere in ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[navnow](../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)]-->.  
  
### To view global dimensions in ledger entry windows  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **Chart of Accounts** window, on the **Navigate** tab, in the **Account** group, choose **Ledger Entries**.  
  
3.  To see only the entries that are relevant, set one or more filters on the window.  
  
4.  To see all the dimensions for an entry, select the entry. On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Account** group, choose **Dimensions**.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The **Ledger Entry Dimensions** window displays the dimensions for one ledger entry at a time. As you scroll through the ledger entries, the content in the **Ledger Entry Dimensions** window changes accordingly.  
  
> [!TIP]  
>  You can insert the global dimension fields to your layout in the ledger entry windows by using the Choose Columns function.  
>   
>  To see only the entries for a certain global dimension, you can use a field filter.
