# How to: Report Intrastat on Forms
To obtain the information that is required on the Intrastat form from the statistical authorities, you must print the **Intrastat â€“ Form** report. Before you can do this, you must prepare the Intrastat journal and fill it in.  
  
### To report to Intrastat on forms  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Intrastat Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **Intrastat Journal** window, select the relevant journal batch in the **Batch Name** field.  
  
3.  If you have not already done this, fill in the journal manually or on the **Actions** tab, in the **General** group, choose **Get Entries**.  
  
4.  On the **Actions** tab, in the **Print** group, choose **Form**.  
  
5.  On the **Intrastat Jnl. Line** FastTab, add a **Type** filter and then select one of the options: **Receipt** or **Shipment**.  
  
6.  Choose the **Print** button to print the report.  
  
     If you have both sales and purchase transactions, you must complete a separate form for each type, so that you must print the report two times.
