2.  Select a vendor, and then, on the **Navigate** tab, in the **Vendor** group, choose **Purchases**.  
  
3.  On the **Options** tab, in the **View by** field, specify in which period you want to view the vendorâ€™s purchases.  
  
4.  In the **View as** field, specify what the view will be based on by selecting one of the following options.
