# User-Defined Method
The program has a facility that allows you to set up user\-defined depreciation methods.  
  
 With a user\-defined method, you use the **Depreciation Tables** window, where you must enter a depreciation percentage for each period \(month, quarter, year, or accounting period\).  
  
 The formula for calculating the depreciation amounts is:  
  
 Depreciation Amount \= \(Depreciation % \* Number of Depreciation Days \* Depr. Basis\) \/ \(100 \* 360\)  
  
## Depreciation Based on Number of Units  
 This user\-defined method can also be used to depreciate based on number of units, for example, in the case of production machines with an established lifetime capacity. In the **Depreciation Tables** window, you can enter the number of units that can be produced in each period \(month, quarter, year, or accounting period\).  
  
 For an example, see [Example \- User\-Defined Depreciation Method](../Finance/example-user-defined-depreciation-method.md) for more information.
