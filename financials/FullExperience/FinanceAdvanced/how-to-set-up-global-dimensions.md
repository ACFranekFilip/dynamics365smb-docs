# How to: Set Up Global Dimensions
A global dimension is a dimension that you can use as a filter anywhere in [!INCLUDE[navnow](../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)]. You can set up two dimensions as global dimensions. Choose the two dimensions that you will use most frequently in your reports. You can, however, use any dimension as a filter in the **Analysis by Dimensions** window.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Changing a global dimension requires that the program makes changes to all the entries posted using that dimension. This can take some time. To avoid having to make such a change, you should choose your global dimensions carefully.  
  
### To set up global dimensions  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **General Ledger Setup** window, on the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Change Global Dimensions**.  
  
3.  In the **Global Dimension 1** and **Global Dimension 2** fields, enter a dimension code.  
  
4.  View the global dimensions on the **Dimensions** FastTab.
