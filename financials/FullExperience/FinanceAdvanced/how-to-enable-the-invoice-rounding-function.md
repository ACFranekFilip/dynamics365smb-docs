# How to: Enable the Invoice Rounding Function
To make sure that sales and purchase invoices are rounded automatically, you must activate the invoice rounding function.  
  
### To activate the invoice rounding function  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup** or **Purchases & Payables Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  On the **General** FastTab, select the **Invoice Rounding** check box.  
  
 You can activate invoice rounding separately for sales and purchase invoices.
