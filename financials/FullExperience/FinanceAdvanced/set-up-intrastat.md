# Set Up Intrastat
If your company is in the European Union \(EU\), you must report the extent of your trade with other EU countries\/regions.  
  
 You can prepare a report based on entries in an Intrastat journal. To record the information that the Intrastat authorities require, you must:  
  
-   Set up tariff numbers and assign them to items.  
  
-   Set up transaction types and transport methods and assign them to sales and purchase documents.  
  
 Optionally, you can also set up transaction specifications, areas, and entry\/exit points.  
  
 You must also set up Intrastat journal templates and batches.  
  
 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them. These tasks are listed in the order in which they are generally performed.
