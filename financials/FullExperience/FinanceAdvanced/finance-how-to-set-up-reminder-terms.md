# How to: Set Up Reminder Terms
Management of receivables includes checking whether amounts due are paid on time. If customers have overdue payments, you must decide when and how to send them a reminder. In addition, you may want to debit their accounts for interest and\/or fees.  
  
 You can set up any number of reminder terms. Each set of terms is identified by a code.  
  
### To set up reminder terms  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Reminder Terms**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Fill in the various fields.  
  
3.  If you want to use more than one combination of the settings, you must set up a code for each one.
