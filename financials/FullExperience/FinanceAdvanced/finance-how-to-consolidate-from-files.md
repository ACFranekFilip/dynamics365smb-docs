# How to: Consolidate from Files
After you have tested the data, you can start the consolidation. This means that you can import the data from the business units in the same database or from files.  
  
### To consolidate from files  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Business Units**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **Business Units** window, on the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Import File**.  
  
3.  On the **Options** FastTab, enter the name of the file including drive and path. Then enter the document number to be assigned to the imported entries.  
  
4.  Choose the **OK** button to start the import.
