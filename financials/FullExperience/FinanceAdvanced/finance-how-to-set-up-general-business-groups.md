# How to: Set Up General Business Groups
You use business group codes to determine posting according to the location (country/region) of the customer or vendor involved in the transaction.  
  
### To set up general business groups  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Gen. Business Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **Gen. Business Posting Groups** window, on the **Home** tab, choose **Edit**.  
  
3.  Enter a code in the **Code** field to identify the group.  
  
4.  In the **Description** field, enter a brief description of the group.  
  
5.  Repeat this procedure for each business group you want to set up.  
  
> [!NOTE]
