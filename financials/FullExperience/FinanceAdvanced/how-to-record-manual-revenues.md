# How to: Record Manual Revenues
You can record manual revenues.  
  
 Manual revenues are items such as rental income, interest from financial assets, or new private capital.  
  
 To repeatedly record similar or identical manual revenues, you can use the functions that are integrated in the cash flow forecast to record the recurring amounts.  
  
 The following procedure describes how to record the recurring entry of 1,000.00 LCY as manual revenue for rental income at the end of each month from January 31, 2013 to December 31, 2013.  
  
### To record manual revenues  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Cash Flow Manual Revenues**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  On the **Home** tab, in the **New** group, choose **New**.  
  
3.  In the **Code** field, enter a code for the manual revenue. This step is required.  
  
4.  In the **Cash Flow Account No.** field, enter an account number to which the rental income is recorded.  
  
5.  In the **Starting Date** field, enter **January 31, 2013**  
  
6.  In the **Ending Date** field, enter **December 31, 2013**.  
  
7.  In the **Recurring Frequency** field, enter **1M** to record the rental revenue on monthly basis.
