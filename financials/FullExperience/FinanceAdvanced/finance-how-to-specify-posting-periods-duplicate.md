# How to: Specify Posting Periods
When you specify posting periods, you limit the period in which posting is allowed.  
  
### To specify posting periods  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **General Ledger Setup** window, on the **General** FastTab, enter a date in the **Allow Posting From** field to specify the beginning of the period.  
  
3.  To specify the end of the period, enter a date in the **Allow Posting To** field.  
  
 The dates that you define here apply to the company and to all users.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If you want to define different posting periods for different users, you can set them up for each user in the **User Setup** window. If you enter dates here, the dates entered on the **General** FastTab in the **General Ledger Setup** window will not apply to these users.
