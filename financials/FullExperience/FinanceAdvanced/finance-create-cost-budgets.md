# Create Cost Budgets
Budgeting in cost accounting resembles budgeting in the general ledger. A cost budget is created based on cost types just as a budget for the general ledger is created based on general ledger accounts.  
  
 A cost budget is created for a certain period of time, for example, a fiscal year. You can create as many cost budgets as needed. You can create a new cost budget manually, or by importing a cost budget, or by copying an existing cost budget as the budget base.  
  
 The following table describes a sequence of tasks to manage cost budgets, with links to the topics that describe them. These tasks are listed in the order in which they are generally performed.
