# How to: Set Up Duplication Lists
When you fill in journal lines to be posted to a depreciation book, you can duplicate the lines in a separate journal, after which they can be posted to a different depreciation book.  
  
### To set up duplication lists  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Depreciation Books**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select a depreciation book.  
  
3.  On the **Home** tab, in the **New** group, choose **New** to open the **Depreciation Book Card** window.  
  
4.  On the **Duplication** FastTab, select the **Part of Duplication List** field.  
  
5.  Close the window.
