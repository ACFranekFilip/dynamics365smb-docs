# How to: Enter Dimension Values on Entries
Dimension value codes are always company\-defined.  
  
### To view dimension values for a company  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Dimensions**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the relevant dimension. On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Dimension** group, choose **Dimension Values**.  
  
### To enter dimension values on entries  
  
1.  Open the relevant sales document, or create a new one and fill in the fields in both the header and on the entry line. FIX INCLUDE HERE<!--[!INCLUDE[bp_fieldhelp]()] -->  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You can enter dimension values in sales and purchase documents and in all journals. The following procedure is for entering dimension values on a sales document.  
  
2.  Choose the line for which you want to enter dimensions. On the **Lines** FastTab, on the **Line** menu, choose **Dimensions**.  
  
3.  In the **Edit Dimension Set Entries** window, select a new line, and then select the relevant dimension and dimension value. Close the window.  
  
4.  On **Home** tab, choose **Post** to post the document.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The **Edit Dimension Set Entries** window may already display some dimensions and their dimension values. These are the default dimensions related to the account types that you have entered in the header and on the entry line. You can choose to enter another dimension value than the proposed default, depending on which option you have set up in the **Value Posting** field for the default dimension.  
>   
>  Note that the same window for journals is called the **Journal Line Dimension** window.  
>   
>  For more information, see Default Dimension and Value Posting.  
  
> [!TIP]  
>  You can enter up to eight dimensions values directly on the entry line. To insert the available dimensions, use the Choose Columns function.
