# How to: Consolidate from Databases
After you have tested the data, you can start the consolidation. This means that you can import the data from the business units in the same database or from files.  
  
### To consolidate from databases  
  
1.  Make sure that you are in the consolidated company.  
  
2.  In the **Search** box, enter **Business Units**, and then choose the related link.  
  
3.  In the **Business Units** window, on the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Import Database**.  
  
4.  On the **Business Unit** FastTab, you can set a filter in the **Code** field to select the business units that will be consolidated.  
  
5.  On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the appropriate fields. For Help about a specific field, choose the field and press F1.  
  
6.  In the **Copy Dimensions** field, choose the field to select the dimension codes.
