# How to: View Check Ledger Entries
When you post a payment journal line where the **Bank Payment Type** field contains **Computer Check** or **Manual Check**, a check ledger entry is created. You can view these check ledger entries from the bank account card from which the checks are issued.  
  
### To view check ledger entries  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Bank Account**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Open the card for the bank account whose check ledger entries you want to see.  
  
3.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Bank Acc.** group, choose **Check Ledger Entries**.  
  
 The **Entry Status** field contains information about the current status of the check.
