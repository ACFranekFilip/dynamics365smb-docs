# How to: Create Sales Credit Memos
A sales credit memo is typically used when a customer returns an item, but it can also be used to give a customer compensation such as a sales allowance and to correct an erroneous invoice.  
  
 If you use the invoicing features, it is a good idea to use credit memos too. They make it easier to manage your receivables.  
  
### To create a sales credit memo  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Sales Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  On the **Home** tab, in the **New** group, choose **New**. Create a new sales credit memo.  
  
3.  Fill in the **No.** field.  
  
4.  In the **Sell-to Customer No.** field, enter the number of the customer that returned the items.  
  
5.  You can fill in the lines manually, or you have two options for filling the credit memo lines automatically:  
  
    -   You can use the  **Copy Document** batch job to copy an existing document to the credit memo. Use this function to copy the entire document. It can be either a posted document or a document that is not yet posted.  
  
    -   You can use the **Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** function to copy one or more posted document lines from one or more posted documents. This functionâ€™s purpose is to allow you to exactly reverse the costs from the posted document line.  
  
6.  On the **Invoicing** FastTab, you can see the other information that was copied from the customer card. If you want to post the credit memo to a different customer than the one specified on the **General** FastTab, enter the number of that customer in the **Bill-to Customer No.** field.  
  
7.  You can compare the credit memo to the original posted document, for example, in the **Posted Sales Invoices** window.  
  
8.  In the **Posting Date** and **Document Date** fields, enter a date.  
  
9. On the credit memo lines, enter information about the items that have been returned or the sales allowance that will be sent.  
  
     You can apply the credit memo line to a specific item ledger entry, job entry, or service entry, and you can assign item charges cost to it.  
  
 If the **Return Receipt on Credit Memo** field is selected in the Sales & Receivables setup, a posted return receipt will be created when the credit memo is posted.
