# How to: Set Up Reminder Levels
Management of receivables includes checking whether amounts due are paid on time. If customers have overdue payments, you must decide when and how to send them a reminder. In addition, you may want to debit their accounts for interest and\/or fees.  
  
### To set up reminder levels  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Reminder Terms**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **Reminder Terms** window, select the line with the terms you want to set up levels for.  
  
3.  On the **Actions** tab, in the **General** group, choose **Levels**. The **Reminder Levels** window opens.  
  
4.  Fill in the various fields.
