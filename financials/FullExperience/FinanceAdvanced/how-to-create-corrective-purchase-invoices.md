# How to: Create Corrective Purchase Invoices
If you have posted a purchase return order as shipped, but the item is subsequently rejected, you must invoice the purchase return order to complete the transaction. ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[navnow](../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)]--> creates a posted purchase credit memo in the process. Then you can issue a corrective purchase invoice to counter the posted purchase credit memo.  
  
### To create a corrective purchase invoice  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Purchase Invoice**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **Purchase Invoice** window, create a new purchase invoice. For more information, see [How to: Record Purchases](../Finance/how-to-record-purchases.md).  
  
3.  On the **Home** tab, in the **Process** group, choose **Copy Purchase Document** to copy the lines from the incorrectly posted purchase credit memo.
