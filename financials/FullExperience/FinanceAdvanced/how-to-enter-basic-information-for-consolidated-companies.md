# How to: Enter Basic Information for Consolidated Companies
To consolidate several companies' figures in a consolidated company, you must first enter information about the business units \(companies\) to be included and about the degree to which their figures will be included. You can use any number of business units in a consolidation.  
  
### To enter basic information for consolidated companies  
  
1.  Open the consolidated company. On the [!INCLUDE[navnow](../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)] menu, choose **Select Company**.  
  
2.  In the **Search** box, enter **Business Units**, and then choose the related link.  
  
3.  In the **\($ N\_241 Business Unit Card $\)** window, for each business unit, create a new business unit card. You must fill in the **Code**, **Company Name**, **Consolidate**, and **Consolidation %** fields. For Help about a specific field, choose the field and press F1.  
  
4.  If the business unit's financial statements are in a different currency than those of the consolidated company, the following fields are required: **Currency Code**, **Exch. Rate Gains Acc.**, **Exch. Rate Loss Acc.**, and **Residual Account**.  
  
5.  Fill in the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields if the business unit's fiscal year differs from that of the consolidated company.  
  
6.  After entering this information for all the business units to be consolidated, close the window.  
  
 If your business unit uses a foreign currency, you must specify the exchange rate that must be used in the consolidation. You must also enter consolidation information about the business unit's general ledger accounts.
