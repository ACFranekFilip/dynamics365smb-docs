# How to: Delete Cost Budget Entries
You use the **Delete Cost Budget Entries** batch job to cancel cost budget entries from the cost budget register.  
  
 To prevent any gaps in the cost budget entries and cost register entries, you cannot delete a single entry or a batch of entries in the middle of the list of register entries.  
  
### To delete a cost budget entry  
  
1.  In the Search box, enter **Delete Cost Budget Entries**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  The **\($ B\_1139\_F\_1\_3 To Register No. $\)** field contains the last register entry number and cannot be changed.  
  
3.  You can use the **\($ B\_1139\_F\_1\_1 From Register No. $\)** field to select a register entry number from which the deletion should begin.  
  
4.  Choose the **OK** button to delete the selected cost budget entries.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  To avoid an accidental deletion of cost budget entries, you can close register entries by marking the lines as **Closed** in the **Closed** field in the **Cost Budget Registers** window.
