# How to: Set Up WIP Accounts for Posting Material Consumption
Material consumption credits the inventory account and debits the WIP account.  
  
 However, you must first set up the WIP account.  
  
### To set up WIP accounts for posting material consumption  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Inventory Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  On the **Actions** tab, in the **General** group, choose **Setup**.  
  
3.  Choose the **WIP Account** field, and select the general ledger account where your ongoing consumption costs are recorded. For more information, see [Design Details: Production Order Posting](../ApplicationDesign/design-details-production-order-posting.md).
