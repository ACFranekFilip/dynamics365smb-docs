# How to: Create Fixed Assets
When you set up a new fixed asset, there are fields that must always be filled in, fields that can be filled in as needed and fields in which you cannot enter anything.  
  
### To create fixed assets  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  On the **Home** tab, in the **Manage** group, choose **New** to create a new fixed asset.  
  
3.  Fill in the fields.  
  
     The **No.** field is required.  
  
4.  Close the window.
