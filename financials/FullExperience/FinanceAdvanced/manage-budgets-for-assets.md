# Manage Budgets for Assets
You can set up budgeted assets. This makes it possible to include any anticipated acquisitions and sales in reports.  
  
 To prepare your budgeted income statement, budgeted balance sheet and cash budget, you need information about future investments, disposals and depreciation of fixed assets. You can get this information from the **Fixed Asset \- Projected Value** report. Before you print this report, you must prepare the budget.  
  
 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them. These tasks are listed in the order in which they are generally performed.
