# Work with Cash Flow Worksheets
In the cash flow worksheet, you register the forecasted transactions of cash inflows and outflows periodically with a batch job. You can manually edit the registered cash inflows and outflows and enter additional lines. To handle all this, it is important to learn to work with the cash flow worksheet.  
  
 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe how to update cash flow forecasts. These tasks are listed in the order in which they are generally performed.
