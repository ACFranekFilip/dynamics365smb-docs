If a payment discount has been calculated on the basis of an invoice amount that includes VAT, you have the possibility of having the payment discount part of the VAT amount reverted when the payment discount is granted.  
  
### To revert VAT on payment discounts  
  
1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  On the **General** FastTab, select the **Adjust for Payment Disc.** field.  
  
3.  Open the ![Shortcut icon](../bp_choose_columns_md.md)]-->  
  
     Note that you must activate the **Adjust for Payments Disc.** field in both the general ledger setup in general and the VAT posting setup for specific combinations of a VAT business posting group and a VAT product posting group.
