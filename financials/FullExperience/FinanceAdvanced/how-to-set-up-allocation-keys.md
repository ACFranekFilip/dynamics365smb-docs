# How to: Set Up Allocation Keys
Transactions can be allocated to various departments or projects, according to user\-defined allocation keys. For example, you could set up an allocation key to allocate depreciation costs on cars with 35 percent to the administration department and 65 percent to the sales department.  
  
 Allocation keys apply to fixed asset classes and not to individual assets.  
  
### To set up fixed assets allocation keys  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **FA Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Posting Gr**. group, select **Allocations**, and then choose a posting type. The **FA Allocations** window appears.  
  
3.  Fill in the relevant fields.  
  
4.  Repeat this procedure for each of the posting types that you want to define allocation keys for.
