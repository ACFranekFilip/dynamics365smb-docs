# How to: Set Up Locations
You can keep track of items in different locations by setting up locations.  
  
 You must set up a Location card and location code for each warehouse location or distribution center location. When you record increases or decreases in inventory, you enter the code for the relevant location. Then you can always see where specific items are in stock.  
  
### To set up a location  
  
1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Create a new **Location** card. On the **Home** tab, in the **New** group, choose **New**.  
  
3.  Fill in the fields. For help about a specific field, select the field and press the F1 key.
