# How to: Set Up a Warehouse to Use ADCS
To use ADCS, you must specify which warehouse locations use the technology.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  We recommend that you do not set up a warehouse to use ADCS if the warehouse also has a bin capacity policy. For more information, see the section "Resolving a web service exception about callback functions" in [Troubleshooting: ADCS](../Troubleshooting:%20ADCS.md).  
  
### To set up a warehouse to use ADCS  
  
1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Location List**, and choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select a warehouse from the list for which you want to enable ADCS. On the **Home** tab, in the **Manage** group, choose **Edit**. The **Location Card** window opens.  
  
3.  Expand the **Warehouse** FastTab and select the **Use ADCS** check box.
