# How to: Set Up Transfer Routes
You can set up your transfer routes and assign a default in\-transit code, shipping agent code, and shipping agent service code. The shipping time of the shipping agent service is used to calculate the receipt date at the transfer\-to location.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Before you set up transfer routes, you must set up the necessary in\-transit codes.  
  
### To set up a transfer route  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **\($ N\_5747 Transfer Routes $\)**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **Transfer Routes** window, on the **Options** FastTab, specify which codes to show in the **Transfer Routes Matrix** window.  
  
3.  On the **Actions** tab, in the **General** group, choose **Show Matrix**. The **Transfer Routes Matrix** window opens.  
  
4.  To create or edit a transfer route, choose a cell in the matrix that represents a combination of the transfer\-to and transfer\-from locations in question.  
  
5.  In the **Trans. Route Spec.** window, fill in the **In\-Transit Code**, **Shipping Agent**, and **Shipping Agent Service** fields.
