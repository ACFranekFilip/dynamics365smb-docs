# How to: Create Individual Bins
The most effective way to create the bins of your warehouse is to generate groups of similar bins in the bin creation worksheet, but you can also create your bins individually as follows.  
  
### To create a bin from the location card  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Locations**, and choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the location that you want to create a bin from.  
  
3.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Location** group, choose **Bins**.  
  
4.  Create a new bin.  
  
5.  Fill in the **Code** field and other fields that are important for the particular bin.  
  
### To create bins individually in the bin creation worksheet  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **\($ N\_7372 Bin Creation Worksheet $\)**, and choose the related link.  
  
2.  Fill in on each line the fields that are necessary to name and characterize the bins you are creating.  
  
3.  On the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Create Bins**.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The **Bin Creation Worksheet** also contains a function that will create the bin lines for you. For more information, see [Creating Bins in the Worksheet](../WarehouseActivities/how-to-create-bins-in-the-bin-creation-worksheet.md).
