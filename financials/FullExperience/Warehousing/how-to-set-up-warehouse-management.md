# How to: Set Up Warehouse Management
Before you can use warehouse documents to control your inventory movements, you must set up certain criteria in the **Warehouse Mgt. Setup** window.  
  
### To set up warehouse management  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Warehouse Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  On the **General** FastTab, select the functionality you want implemented in the warehouses. Options are **Require Receive**, **Require Put\-away**, **Require Shipment**, and **Require Pick**.  
  
3.  On the **General** FastTab, in the **Receipt Posting Policy** and the **Shipment Posting Policy** fields, select **Posting errors are not processed** if you do not want to show any posting errors. Select **Stop and show the first posting error** if you want to show the posting errors.  
  
4.  On the **Numbering** FastTab, specify the number series that are used to automatically assign numbers to warehouse activity documents.
