# Warehouse Activities
After goods are received and before goods are shipped, a series of internal warehouse activities take place to ensure an effective flow through the warehouse and to organize and maintain company inventories. Like the [receiving](../Receiving/receiving.md) and [shipping](../Topic/Shipping.md) processes, the detail level of warehouse activities can vary depending on the scope of the license and the [locations setup](../WarehouseActivities/configure-warehouse-processes.md).  
  
 Typical warehouse activities include putting items away, moving items inside or between warehouses, and picking items for assembly, production, or shipment. Assembling items for sale or inventory is also included in warehouse activities.  
  
 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them. These tasks are listed in the order in which they are generally performed.
