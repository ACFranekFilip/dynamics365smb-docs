# How to: Set Up Shipping Agents
You can set up a code for each of your shipping agents and enter information about them.  
  
 If you enter an Internet address for the shipping agent, and the agent provides package tracking services on the Internet, you can use the automatic package tracking feature.  
  
 You can also specify every type of shipping agent service offered by your shipping agents.  
  
### To set up a shipping agent  
  
1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Shipping Agents**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Fill in the various fields.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If you delete the shipping agent on the order line, the shipping agent service code is also deleted. The contents of fields that were based in part on the shipping agent service are recalculated.
