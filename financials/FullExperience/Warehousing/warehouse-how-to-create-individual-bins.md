2.  Select the location that you want to create a bin from.  
  
3.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Location** group, choose **Bins**.  
  
4.  Create a new bin.  
  
5.  Fill in the **Code** field and other fields that are important for the particular bin.  
  
### To create bins individually in the bin creation worksheet  
  
1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Bin Creation Worksheet**, and choose the related link.  
  
2.  Fill in on each line the fields that are necessary to name and characterize the bins you are creating.
