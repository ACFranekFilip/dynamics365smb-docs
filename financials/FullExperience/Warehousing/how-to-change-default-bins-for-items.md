# How to: Change Default Bins for Items
You may need to change the default bin assignment for an item or assign a default bin to a new item.  
  
### To assign or change a default bin for an individual item  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Bin Contents**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **Location Filter** field, select the appropriate location code.  
  
3.  Find the current default bin content entry for the item and clear the **Default Bin** field.  
  
4.  Find the bin content line for the bin that you would like as the new default bin. Select the **Default Bin** field.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  When an item is put away for the first time, and the item does not have a default bin assigned, the system will assign the bin where the item is put away as the default bin for the item.
