# How to: Use Permanent Invoicing Addresses for Vendors
When you purchase goods, you usually receive the invoice from the person or company that you ordered the goods from. But at times, you may receive the invoice from a different vendor. If you need to register invoices that are received from an alternative vendor, you can set up a pay-to vendor permanently on a vendor card.  
  
 Before you can do this, you must have already set up cards for both the vendor that you order the goods from and the vendor that you receive the invoice from.  
  
### To use permanent invoicing addresses for vendors  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the vendor that you want to use a permanent invoicing address with, and then, on the **Home** tab, in the **Manage** group, choose **Edit**.  
  
3.  On the **Invoicing** FastTab, in the **Pay-to Vendor No.** field, enter the number of the vendor with the invoicing address that you want to use permanently.  
  
 Every time you fill in a purchase invoice, this number and the associated name and address are copied to the corresponding fields on the purchase header.
