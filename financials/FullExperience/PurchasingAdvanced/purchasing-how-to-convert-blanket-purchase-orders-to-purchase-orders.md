# How to: Convert Blanket Purchase Orders to Purchase Orders
You can either convert the entire blanket order into one order, or you can make it into a number of separate orders, depending on how you want the blanket order to be invoiced.  
  
 Before you can do this, you must have already set up a blanket order.  
  
### To convert a blanket purchase order to a purchase order  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Blanket Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Open the relevant blanket purchase order   that you want to convert to an order.  
  
3.  On the **Shipping** FastTab, in the **Expected Receipt Date** field, type the same date as the date in the **Expected Receipt Date** field on the first line.  
  
4.  To create an order out of only one blanket order line, fill in the **Qty. to Receive** field on the relevant line.  
  
5.  On the **Actions** tab, in the **General** group, choose **Make Order**.  
  
     A message appears informing you that the blanket order has been assigned an order number. Note that the blanket order has not been deleted.  
  
6.  Choose the **OK** button to close the **Blanket Purchase Order** window.
