# Purchase Invoice Discounts and Service Charges
If you have fixed terms for invoice discounts with any vendors, you can enter them for those vendors. Then the discount will be calculated when you fill in a purchase invoice.  
  
 Before you can use invoice discounts with purchases, you must specify the vendors that offer you the discounts.  
  
 You link discount percentages to specific invoice amounts in **Vend. Invoice Discounts** windows. You can enter any number of percentages in each window. Each vendor can have its own window, or you can link several vendors to the same window.  
  
 In addition to a discount percentage, you can link a service charge amount to a specific invoice amount.  
  
 You can define the terms of the invoice discount in LCY for domestic vendors and in foreign currency for foreign vendors.  
  
 You can choose to have ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[navnow](../../includes/navnow_md.md)]--> automatically calculate the invoice discounts for quotes, blanket orders, orders, invoices, or credit memos.  
  
> [!TIP]  
>  Before you enter this information, it is a good idea to prepare an outline of the discount structure that you want to use. This makes it easier to see which vendors can be linked to the same invoice discount window. The fewer windows that you have to set up, the faster that you can enter the basic information.
