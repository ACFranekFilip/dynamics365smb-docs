 After you have set up the cause of inactivity codes, you can enter a code on the employee card for an employee that is inactive.  
  
### To assign a cause of inactivity code to an employee  
  
1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Employees**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Open the relevant employee card.  
  
3.  On the **Administration** FastTab, in the **Cause of Inactivity Code** field, select the relevant inactivity code.  
  
 Repeat the procedure for all employees that are inactive.
