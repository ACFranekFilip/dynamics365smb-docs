# How to: Access an Overview of Confidential Information
You can quickly get an overview of confidential information related to your employees. This can prove useful for keeping track of how many employees have insurance coverage or participate in a stock option plan, for example.  
  
### To view confidential information  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Employees**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Employee** group, choose **Confidential Info. Overview**. The **Confidential Info. Overview** window opens.  
  
3.  On the **Actions** tab, in the **General** group, choose **Matrix**.  
  
 The columns on the left list the employees. The columns on the right list the various types of confidential information and indicate which employees the information is valid for.
