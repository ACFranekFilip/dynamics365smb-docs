# How to: Register Employee Absences
In order for you to be able to manage employee absences, you must register them.  
  
 You can register employee absences on a daily basis or at some other interval that meets your organizational needs.  
  
### To register employee absences  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Absence Registration**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Create a new absence registration. On the **Home** tab, in the **New** group, choose **New**.  
  
3.  Fill in a line for each employee absence you want to register, and then close the window.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  To obtain meaningful statistics, always use the same unit of measure, hour or day, when registering employee absences.
