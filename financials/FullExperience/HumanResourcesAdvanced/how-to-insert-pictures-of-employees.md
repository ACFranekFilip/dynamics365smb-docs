# How to: Insert Pictures of Employees
If you have a digitalized picture of an employee, that is, a picture that is a file in .bmp format, you can insert it on the employee card.  
  
### To insert a picture of an employee  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Employees**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the relevant employee card.  
  
3.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Employee** group, choose **Picture**.  
  
4.  Right-click on the **Picture** field and choose **Select Picture**.  
  
5.  Select the drive, path, and file name, and then choose **Open**.  
  
 The picture is now imported into the **Employee Picture** window.  
  
 If you want to copy the picture to a separate file, on the **Navigate** tab, in the **Employee** group, choose **Picture**. Right-click on the **Picture** field and choose **Save Picture As**. Specify the drive, path, and file name to which the picture will be exported.
