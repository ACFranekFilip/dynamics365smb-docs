# How to: Assign Confidential Information Codes to Employees
You can set up confidential information codes for confidential information, such as company pension, stock option plan, salary, and so on, related to your employees.  
  
 After you have set up the confidential information codes, you can assign one or more codes to each employee.  
  
### To assign confidential information codes to an employee  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Employees**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Open the relevant employee card.  
  
3.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Employee** group, choose **Confidential Information**.  
  
4.  In the **Confidential Information** window, fill in as many lines as necessary to register the confidential information that is relevant to the employee.
