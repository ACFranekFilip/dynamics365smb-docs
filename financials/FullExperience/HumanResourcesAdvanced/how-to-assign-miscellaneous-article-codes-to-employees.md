# How to: Assign Miscellaneous Article Codes to Employees
You can set up miscellaneous article codes for employee benefits and miscellaneous articles, such as keys, computers, desks, and so on, in your employees’ possession.

### To assign a miscellaneous article code to an employee  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Employees**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Open the relevant employee card.  
  
3.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Employee** group, choose **Misc. Article Information**.  
  
4.  In the **Misc. Article Information** window, fill in as many lines as necessary to register the miscellaneous articles in the employee’s possession.
