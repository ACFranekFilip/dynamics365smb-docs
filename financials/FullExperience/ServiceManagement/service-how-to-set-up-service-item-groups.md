# How to: Set Up Service Item Groups
You can use the **Service Item Groups** window to set up groups of items that are related in terms of repair and maintenance. You can define default values for service items in a service item group, such as response time, contract discount percent, and service price group. For items in a service item group, you can select whether you want them to be automatically registered as service items when they are sold. For more information, see [How to: Create Service Items When Shipping Items](../how-to-create-service-items-when-shipping-items.md).  
  
 You assign service item groups to items on the item card and to service items on the service item card.  
  
### To set up a service item group  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Item Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Create a new service item group.  
  
3.  Fill in the **Code** and **Description** fields.  
  
4.  In the **Default Contract Discount %** field, enter the default contract discount percentage that you want the service items in the group to have.  
  
5.  In the **Default Serv. Price Group Code** field, enter the default service price group code that you want the service items in the group to have.  
  
6.  In the **Default Response Time (Hours)** field, enter the default response time in hours that you want the service items in the group to have.  
  
7.  If you want to register the items in the group as service items when they are sold, select the **Create Service Item** field.  
  
 Repeat these steps for each service item group you want to create.
