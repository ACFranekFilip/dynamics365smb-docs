# How to: Register Resolution Codes
After repairing a service item, you can register a resolution code describing the resolution or method of repair. This code can be used along with the fault codes for future reference on possible methods of repair.  
  
### To register a resolution code  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Tasks**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the service task that includes the relevant service item.  
  
3.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Service Tasks** group, choose **Item Worksheet**.  
  
4.  In the **Resolution Code** field, select an appropriate resolution code. If an appropriate resolution code cannot be found, you can set up a new resolution code.  
  
 Alternatively, you can register both fault and resolution codes using fault\/resolution codes relationships.
