# How to: Set Up Service Item Components from BOMs
If you want to set up components for service items that are BOMs, you can copy the BOM items and create them as service item components.  
  
### To set up service item components from a BOM  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Items**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Open the service item for which you want to set up components from a BOM.  
  
3.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Serv. Item** group, choose **Components**. The **Service Item Component List** window opens.  
  
4.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Component** group, choose **Copy from BOM**.  
  
     If the item that the service item is linked to is a BOM, the components for all the items in the BOM are created automatically.
