# How to: Change Skill Codes for Service Items
You may want to change the skill codes assigned to service items, for example, **PC** to **PCS**. The procedure for changing skill codes is similar to the process of assigning skill codes.  
  
### To change skill codes for a service item  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Item**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the service item you want to assign a skill code to.  
  
3.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Serv. Item** group, choose **Resource Skills**. The **Resource Skills** window opens.  
  
4.  On the line with the code to be changed, in the **Skill Code** field, select the relevant skill code.
