# How to: Assign Troubleshooting Guidelines to Service Item Groups
You can assign troubleshooting guidelines to service item groups to help the technician solve problems or set up a list of questions to ask relating to items in the groups. These troubleshooting guidelines apply to the items and the service items that belong to the groups unless you have assigned troubleshooting guidelines to them directly.  
  
### To assign troubleshooting guidelines to a service item group  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Item Groups**, and then choose the related link. Select the service item group to which you want to assign troubleshooting guidelines.  
  
2.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Service** group, choose **Troubleshooting Setup**. The **Troubleshooting Setup** window opens.  
  
3.  On the **Home** tab, in the **New** group, choose **New** to enter new troubleshooting guidelines for the group.  
  
     The **Type** and **No.** fields are already filled in with the appropriate information for the group.  
  
4.  In the **Troubleshooting No.**  field, select the relevant troubleshooting number, and then choose the **OK** button to copy it to the field.  
  
 Repeat these steps for each set of troubleshooting guidelines you want to assign.
