# Update and Evaluate Contracts
Sometimes you have to change the terms of a contract after it has been created. In most cases, you open the relevant contract in the **Service Contract** window, and change it as necessary.  
  
 You can change the status of the contract, initially set to **Locked**, add and remove contract lines, and cancel a contract. If you want to see how your business is doing as measured by gain and loss, you can do quick business analysis using the contract trendscape feature.  
  
 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them. These tasks are listed in the order in which they are generally performed.
