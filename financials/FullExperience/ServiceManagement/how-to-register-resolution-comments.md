# How to: Register Resolution Comments
You can use the **Resolution Service Comment Sheet** window to register comments on the method or procedure applied to service items in service orders and service quotes.  
  
 The following procedure uses a service order as an example, but the same procedure can apply to service quotes.  
  
### To register resolution comments  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Open the relevant service order.  
  
3.  Select the line you want to register resolution comments for. Choose **Actions**![Action Menu icon](../FullExperience/media/actionmenuicon.png "actionMenuIcon"), choose **Line**, choose **Comments**, and then choose **Resolutions**. The **Resolution Service Comment Sheet** window opens.  
  
4.  In the **Date** field, enter a date.  
  
5.  In the **Comment** field, enter a comment. You can enter a maximum of 80 characters. If you need to enter additional text, go to the next line. You can fill in as many lines as necessary.
