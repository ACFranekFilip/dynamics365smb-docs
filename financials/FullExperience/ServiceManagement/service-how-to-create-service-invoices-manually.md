# How to: Create Service Invoices Manually
Typically, after you post a service order with the **Invoice** or **Ship and Invoice** option, a service invoice is posted automatically. Yet, you may need to issue an invoice that is not linked either to a service contract or to a service order. This procedure explains how to issue an invoice at the same time that the customer receives the service.  
  
### To create a service invoice  
  
1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Service Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Create a new service invoice.  
  
3.  Fill in the **No.** field.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If you have set up number series for service invoices in the **Service Mgt. Setup** window, you can press Enter to select the next available service invoice number.  
  
4.  In the **Customer No.** field, enter the number of a customer. Select the relevant customer from the list.  
  
     The customer fields are filled in with information from the **Customer** card.  
  
5.  Enter a date in the **Posting Date** field. This date will appear on the posted entries. This field is filled with the current working date, but you can change it manually.  
  
6.  Fill in the **Document Date** field. The date you enter here will appear on the printed invoice and will be used to calculate the due date.  
  
7.  Fill in the service lines of the invoice. Fill in the **Type**, **No.**, and **Quantity** fields to register items, resources and  costs that have been used in servicing.
