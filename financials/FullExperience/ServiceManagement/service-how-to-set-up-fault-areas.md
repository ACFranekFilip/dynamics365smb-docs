# How to: Set Up Fault Areas
You can use the **Fault Areas** window to set up fault areas to describe areas of service items faults. The level of fault reporting in your company determines whether you use fault area codes.  
  
### To set up fault areas  
  
1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Fault Areas**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Create a new fault area   code. On the **Home** tab, in the **New** group, choose **New**.  
  
3.  Fill in the **Code** and **Description** fields.  
  
 Repeat these steps to set up as many fault area codes as you want.
