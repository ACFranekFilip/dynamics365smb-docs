# How to: Delete Service Document Log Entries
You can delete the automatically generated service document log entries, for example, the unnecessary or outdated ones.  
  
### To delete service document log entries  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Document Log**, and then choose the related link.  
  
     Alternatively, you can open the Service Document Log for a separate service document. To do this, open the window for the document you want to see the changes logged for, and then on the **Navigate** tab, in the relevant group, such as **Order**, or **Invoice**, and so on, choose **Service Document Log**.  
  
2.  On the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Delete Service Document Log**. The **Delete Service Document Log** batch job request window opens.  
  
3.  Select the log entries that you want to delete by setting filters in the batch job request window, and then choose the **OK** button.  
  
 After you have deleted the selected service document log entries, they are removed automatically from the **Service Document Log** window.
