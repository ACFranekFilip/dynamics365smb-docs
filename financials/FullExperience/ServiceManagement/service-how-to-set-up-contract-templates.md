# How to: Set Up Contract Templates
You can use the **Service Contract Templates** window to set up contract templates as predefined layouts of contracts that include the most commonly used service contract details. When you create service contract quotes, you can create them by using templates. The fields in the contract quote are filled in automatically with the contents of the corresponding template fields.  
  
### To set up a contract template  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Contract Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Create a new service contract template. On the **Home** tab, in the **New** group, choose **New**.  
  
3.  In the **No.** field on the **General** FastTab, enter a number for the contract template.  
  
     Alternatively, if you have set up number series for contract templates in the **Service Mgt. Setup** window, you can press the Enter key to enter the next available contract template number. Fill in the other fields if appropriate.  
  
4.  On the **Invoice** FastTab, fill in the **Serv. Contract Acc. Group Code** field, the **Invoice Period**, and so on. Fill in the other fields if appropriate.  
  
5.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Contract Template** group, choose **Service Discounts** to add contract discounts.
