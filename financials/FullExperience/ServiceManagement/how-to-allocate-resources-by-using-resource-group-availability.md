# How to: Allocate Resources by Using Resource Group Availability
When you have created service orders or quotes, you can make use of resource group availability to allocate resource groups to perform the service tasks in the orders or quotes.  
  
### To allocate a resource using resource group availability  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Dispatch Board**, and choose the related link.  
  
2.  Browse to the relevant service order.  
  
3.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Planning** group, choose **Resource Allocations**.  
  
4.  Select the entry with the service task to which you want to allocate a resource.  
  
5.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Planning** group, choose **Res. Group Availability**.  
  
6.  In the **Res. Group Availability \(Service\)** window, on the **Actions** tab, in the **General** group, choose **Show Matrix**, and select a resource group you want to allocate.  
  
7.  Select a date on which the resource group has enough available hours for the task and which is close to the response date of the service order.  
  
8.  In the **Quantity to Allocate** field, enter the number of hours you want to allocate the resource to the service task for.  
  
9. On the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions,**  group, choose **Allocate** to allocate the selected resource group on the selected date.  
  
     The **Status** field is automatically set to **Active**.  
  
 Repeat these steps for each date that you want to allocate the resource group to the service task.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  For a service item in a service order, there can only be **Active** allocation entries with one resource or resource group at a time.
