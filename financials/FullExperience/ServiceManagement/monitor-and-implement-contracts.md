# Monitor and Implement Contracts
After you have set up a system to initiate and maintain service contracts, you can also monitor and implement the contracts. You can convert quotes into a service contract. Then you can create a service order from a contract by using the **Create Contract Service Orders** batch job. When the order is created, service starts.  
  
 In addition, you can adjust the accounting that is related to service contracts that have an annual amount billing. You can adjust it manually, or set up ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[navnow](../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)]--> to do this automatically.  
  
 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them. These tasks are listed in the order in which they are generally performed.
