# How to: Set Up Service Status Priorities
You use the **Service Order Status Setup** window to set the priority level for service order status options. There are four priorities: High, Medium High, Medium Low, and Low.  
  
 When you change the repair status of a service item in a service order, the service order status is updated. The repair status of each service item is linked to the service order status. If the service items are linked to two or more service order status options, the service order status with the highest priority is selected.  
  
### To set up service status priorities  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Order Status**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the service order status you want to set a priority for.  
  
3.  In the **Priority** field, select the priority you want for this service order status.  
  
 Repeat these steps until you have set the priority for each of the four status options:  **Pending**, **In Process**, **Finished**, and **On Hold***.*
