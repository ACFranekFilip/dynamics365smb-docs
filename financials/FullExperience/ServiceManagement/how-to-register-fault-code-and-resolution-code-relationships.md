# How to: Register Fault Code and Resolution Code Relationships
After repairing a service item, you can register both the fault code and the resolution code for the item by selecting a combination from the existing fault\/resolution codes relationships.  
  
### To register fault\/resolution codes  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Tasks**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the line that includes the relevant service item. On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Service Tasks** group, choose **Item Worksheet**.  
  
3.  In the **Service Item Worksheet** window, on the **Navigate** tab, in the **Worksheet** group, choose **Fault\/Resol. Codes Relationships**. The **Fault\/Resolution Codes Relationships** window opens.  
  
     Filters are set on the relationships that are shown in the window by copying the service item group and the fault codes from the **Service Item Worksheet** window.  
  
4.  Fill out the line. Select the correct combination of fault and resolution codes, and then choose the **OK** button to copy it to the service item. If an appropriate combination cannot be found, you can create a new combination in the window.  
  
 The selected fault and resolution codes now appear in the corresponding fields in the **Service Item Worksheet** window. You can also register the codes directly in this window.
