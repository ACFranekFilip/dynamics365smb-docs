# How to: Create Service Orders
You can use the **Service Order** window to create documents where you enter information about a service, such as repairs and maintenance, on service items by customer request.  
  
 When creating a service order, you only have to fill in a few fields. Some fields are optional and many are automatically filled in when you fill in related fields.  
  
### To create a service order  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Create a new service order.  
  
3.  In the **No.** field, enter a number for the service order.  
  
     Alternatively, if you have set up number series for service orders in the **Service Mgt. Setup** window, you can press Enter to select the next available service order number.  
  
4.  In the **Customer No.** field, select the relevant customer from the list.  
  
     The customer-relevant fields are filled in with information from the **Customer** table.  
  
5.  Depending on the settings on the **Mandatory Fields** FastTab in the **Service Mgt. Setup** window, you may need to fill in the **Service Order Type** field on the **General** FastTab and the **Salesperson Code** field on the **Invoicing** FastTab.  
  
6.  Optionally, fill in the rest of the fields.  
  
7.  Register the service item lines.
