# How to: Assign Resources to Service Zones
When you allocate a resource, for example, a technician, to a service task that is to be performed at the customer site, you can select a resource that is assigned to the same service zone as the customer. Therefore, you need to know to which service zones resources are assigned.  
  
 You set up how you use service zones in the **Service Zones Option** field in the **Service Mgt. Setup** window.  
  
### To assign a resource to a service zone  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Resource Service Zones**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Create a new resource service zones assignment.  
  
3.  In the **Resource No.** field, select the resource that you want to assign to a service zone.  
  
4.  In the **Service Zone Code** field, select the service zone that you want to assign the resource to.  
  
5.  In the **Starting Date** field, you can enter the date from which the resource will be located in the service zone.  
  
 Repeat these steps for each assignment you want to enter.
