# How to: View Additional Information About Posted Service Documents
When you post a service invoice, a service shipment, or a service credit memo, the information on the document is transferred to the **Posted Service Invoice**, **Posted Service Shipment**, or **Posted Service Credit Memo** windows respectively. You cannot enter, change, or delete anything in these windows. You can print a shipment, invoice, or credit memo from these windows.  
  
 The following procedure uses a posted service invoice as an example, but the same procedure can apply to posted service shipments and posted credit memos.  
  
### To view additional information about a posted service document  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Posted Service Invoice**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Open the posted service invoice you want to view.  
  
3.  To get an overview of the posted invoice, on the **Navigate** tab, in the **Invoice** group, choose **Statistics**.  
  
     The **Service Order Statistics** window opens. The window displays information such as quantity, amount, VAT, cost, profit, and customer credit limit for the posted document.  
  
 After a period of time, you may have a large amount of outdated information in these windows. To save space in the database, you can delete the documents you have already printed.
