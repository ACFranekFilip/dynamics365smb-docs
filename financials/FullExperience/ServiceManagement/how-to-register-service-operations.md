# How to: Register Service Operations
When performing a service on a service order, you can register the details specifying the items used, costs incurred, and the time spent.  
  
### To register service operations  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Open the service order that you want to register the service for.  
  
3.  In the **Service Order** window, select the appropriate item line. Choose **Actions**![Action Menu icon](../DesignAndEngineering/media/actionmenuicon.png "actionMenuIcon"), choose **Line**, and then choose **Service Item Worksheet.**  
  
4.  On the lines, specify the items used, costs incurred, and the time spent on the service.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You can also register service directly on the service lines linked to the service order.  
  
 The data you specify is stored in the **Service Item Worksheet** window. You can update the data when necessary.
