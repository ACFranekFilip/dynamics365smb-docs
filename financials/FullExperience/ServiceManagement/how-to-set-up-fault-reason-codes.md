# How to: Set Up Fault Reason Codes
You can use the **Fault Reason Codes** window to set up fault reasons codes to describe the reason for service item faults and, if necessary, to exclude warranty and contract discounts. For example, you might want to exclude warranty and contract discount when the customer spills water on the service item.  
  
### To set up fault reason codes  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Fault Reason Codes**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Create a new fault reason code. On the **Home** tab, in the **New** group, choose **New**.  
  
3.  Fill in the **Code** and **Description** fields.  
  
4.  Select the **Exclude Warranty Discount** and **Exclude Contract Discount** fields if appropriate for this fault reason code.  
  
 Repeat these steps to set up as many fault reason codes as you want.
