# How to: Create Service Contracts and Service Contract Quotes
You can create a service contract either manually or from a service contract quote. You can use a service contract quote as a forerunner of a service contract, in which your company makes an offer to the customer and obtains customer approval before you can convert it to a service contract. The procedures for creating either a service contract or service contract quote are similar.  
  
### To create a service contract or service contract quote  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Contracts** or **Service Contract Quotes**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  On the **Home** tab, in the **New** group, choose **New** to create a new service contract or service contract quote.  
  
3.  Fill in the **No.** field. A dialog box opens, asking whether you want to fill it with the common data from a contract template. If you want to create such a service contract or service contract quote, choose the **Yes** button. The **Service Contract Template List** window opens.  
  
4.  Select the appropriate template, and then choose the **OK** button to use it to create the service contract or service contract quote.  
  
5.  In the **Customer No.** field on the **General** FastTab, select the appropriate customer.  
  
6.  Select the **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** field on the **Invoice Details** FastTab if you do not want an annual amount difference to be distributed automatically. The values in the **Annual Amount** and **Calcd. Annual Amount** fields are not automatically equalized. If you want the program to do automatically distribute any annual amount difference that might occur from a change in the service contract, leave the **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** check box clear.  
  
7.  Add contract lines to the service contract or service contract quote.  
  
8.  Fill in the rest of the fields in the **Service Contract Quote** window as needed.
