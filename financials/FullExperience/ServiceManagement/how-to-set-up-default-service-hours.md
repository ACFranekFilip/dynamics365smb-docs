# How to: Set Up Default Service Hours
You use the **Default Service Hours** window to set up the usual service working hours in your company. These service hours are used to calculate the response date and time for service orders and quotes and to send response time warnings. The default service hours are used for service contracts unless you specify special service hours for a contract.  
  
### To set up default service hours  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Default Service Hours**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Create a new default service hour entry.  
  
3.  On the lines, in the **Starting Date** field, enter the date the service hours are valid from. If you leave this field empty, the service hours are always valid.  
  
4.  In the **Day** field, select the day of the week you are defining service hours entry for. This field must be filled in.  
  
5.  In the **Starting Time** and **Ending Time** fields, insert the starting and ending time of service hours for the service hours entry. These fields must be filled in.  
  
6.  In the **Valid on Holidays** field, select the check box if you want the service hours entry to be valid on holidays.  
  
 Repeat these steps for each day of the week your company is open.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  If you leave the lines in the **Default Service Hours** window empty, the default value is 24 hours, valid only for calendar working days.
