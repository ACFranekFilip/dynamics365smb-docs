# How to: Set Up Service Costs
You can use the **Service Costs** window to set up cost codes with set prices for specific service costs, such as travel costs to particular service zones, and so on.  
  
### To set up a service cost  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Costs**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Create a new service cost.  
  
3.  Fill in the **Code** and **Description** fields.  
  
4.  In the **Cost Type** field, select whether the cost is a travel cost, a support cost, or other.  
  
5.  In the **Account No.** field, select the account you want the cost amount posted to.  
  
6.  If the cost type is **Travel**, in the **Service Zone Code** field, select the relevant service zone.  
  
7.  Fill in the other fields in the **Service Costs** window.  
  
 Repeat these steps for each service cost you want to create.
