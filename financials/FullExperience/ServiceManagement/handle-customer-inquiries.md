# Handle Customer Inquiries
A service management application must interface with a customer request for service. That service request usually is translated into a service order. [!INCLUDE[navnow](../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)] provides tools to create an order both directly in response to a customer request or as part of the contract process, if that is how your application is set up.  
  
 If needed, you can manage a loaner program for your customers. You can also determine your pricing structure, put service pricing offerings into logical groupings, and create price adjustments.  
  
 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them. These tasks are listed in the order in which they are generally performed.
