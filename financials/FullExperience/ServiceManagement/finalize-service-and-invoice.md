# Finalize Service and Invoice
Ease in invoicing your service orders is a key feature of FIX INCLUDE HERE<!--[!INCLUDE[navnow](../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)] -->. You can send an invoice to your customers at any time, or create invoices periodically.  
  
 To create an invoice directly, you can use the **Service Contract** window. You can also set up your system so that a service technician in the field can create an invoice for service that is not connected to a contract or order.  
  
 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them. These tasks are listed in the order in which they are generally performed.
