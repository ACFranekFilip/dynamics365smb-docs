# How to: View Service Order Statistics
When you have created a service order and filled in the lines, you can see the resulting totals in the **Service Order Statistics** window.  
  
### To view service order statistics  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Orders**, and choose the related link.  
  
2.  Create a service order and fill in the service item lines and service lines linked to the order with the relevant information.  
  
3.  From the order, on the **Navigate** tab, in the **Order** group, choose **Statistics**.  
  
4.  In the **Service Order Statistics** window, on the **General** FastTab, you can see summary information about the entire order based on the total quantity in the **Quantity** fields on the service lines.  
  
5.  The **Shipping** FastTab displays information about the items, resources, and costs to be shipped. The values specified in the **Qty. to Ship** field are used on each of the service lines.  
  
6.  On the **Details** FastTab, you can view the information about the items, resource hours, and costs to be invoiced and consumed. The **Qty. to Invoice** and **Qty. to Consume** fields are used on the service lines to produce the information.  
  
7.  On the **Service Line** FastTab, you can see the amounts on different kinds of service lines in the service order. The amounts are shown separately for items, resources, costs, and general ledger accounts.  
  
8.  On the **Customer** FastTab, you can view basic accounting information for the customer on the service order.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If something must be corrected, you can return to the service order and make the necessary changes.
