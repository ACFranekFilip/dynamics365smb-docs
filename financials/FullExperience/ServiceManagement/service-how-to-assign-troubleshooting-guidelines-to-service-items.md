# How to: Assign Troubleshooting Guidelines to Service Items
You can assign troubleshooting guidelines to service items to help the technician solve problems or set up a list of questions to ask relating to the specific service items.  
  
 If you do not assign troubleshooting guidelines to a service item, the service item inherits the troubleshooting guidelines assigned to the item it is linked to, just as the item also inherits the troubleshooting guidelines assigned to the service item group it belongs to.  
  
### To assign troubleshooting guidelines to a service item  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Item List**, and then choose the related link. Select the service item to which you want to assign troubleshooting guidelines.  
  
2.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Serv. Item** group, choose **Troubleshooting Setup**. The **Troubleshooting Setup** window opens.  
  
3.  On the **Home** tab, choose **New** to enter new troubleshooting guidelines for the service item. The **Type** and **No.** fields are already filled in with the appropriate information for the service item.  
  
4.  In the **Troubleshooting No.** field, select the relevant troubleshooting number.  
  
 Repeat these steps for each set of troubleshooting guidelines you want to assign.
