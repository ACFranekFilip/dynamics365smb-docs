# How to: Assign Troubleshooting Guidelines to Items
You can assign troubleshooting guidelines to items to help the technician solve problems or set up a list of questions to ask relating to the specific items. These troubleshooting guidelines also apply to the service items that represent the items unless you have assigned troubleshooting guidelines to them directly.  
  
 If you do not assign troubleshooting guidelines to an item, the item inherits the troubleshooting assigned to the service item group it belongs to.  
  
### To assign troubleshooting guidelines to an item  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link. Select the item to which you want to assign troubleshooting.  
  
2.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Service** group, choose **Troubleshooting**, and then choose **Troubleshooting Setup**. The **Troubleshooting Setup** window opens.  
  
3.  On the **Actions** tab, choose **New** to assign new troubleshooting guidelines for the item.  
  
     The **Type** and **No.** fields are already filled in with the appropriate information for the item.  
  
4.  In the **Troubleshooting No.** field, select the relevant troubleshooting number.  
  
 Repeat these steps for each set of troubleshooting guidelines you want to assign.
