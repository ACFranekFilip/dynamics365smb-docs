# How to: Print Test Reports Before Posting Service Documents
When you have created a service document, such as an order, invoice, or credit memo, and filled in all the information, you can post the document.  
  
 To ensure that posting can be done without problems, you can test the document. The following procedure uses a service invoice as an example, but the same procedure can apply to service orders and service credit memos.  
  
### To print test reports before posting service documents  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Open the service invoice that you want to test.  
  
3.  On the Actions tab, in the **Posting** group, choose **Test Report**.  
  
4.  Fill in the relevant information in the report request window.  
  
5.  Choose the **Print** button to print the report or the **Preview** button to preview the report on the screen.  
  
 The document is checked for any errors or a lack of information, and the results are reported. If there are any errors, you must correct the problem. You can then print a new test report and post the document.
