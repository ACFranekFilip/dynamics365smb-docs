# Plan and Allocate Service Orders
To help plan the satisfaction of service, you can use the **Dispatch Board**, which provides an overview of all outstanding orders, quotes, or invoices, depending on the document filter that you selected. The **Dispatch Board** also lets you refine your view, such as using an additional filter that is based on order status. Multiple combinations of filters is allowed.  
  
 In some cases, you may want to send notification to a customer stating that service is complete. There are two ways to do this: manually or by automating the process if it is attached to a job queue.  
  
 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them. These tasks are listed in the order in which they are generally performed.
