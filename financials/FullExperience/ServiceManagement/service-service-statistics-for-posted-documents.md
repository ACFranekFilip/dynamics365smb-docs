# Service Statistics for Posted Documents
The service statistics feature lets you gain a statistical overview of the contents of posted service documents, such as a posted shipment, posted invoice, and posted credit memo.  
  
 The statistical information is displayed in the statistics window for the corresponding posted service document. You can open the relevant statistics window from posted service shipment, posted service invoice, or posted service credit memo documents. For each of these document types, on the **Home** tab, in the **Process** group, choose **Statistics**. For example, from the **Posted Service Invoices** window, on the **Home** tab, in the **Process** group, choose **Statistics**.
