# Identify People and Resources
The key element to service management is the people who supply service. By using FIX INCLUDE HERE<!--[!INCLUDE[navnow](../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)] -->, you can set up an application that assigns the appropriate people to the appropriate jobs. Assignments can be based on service zones where the people are located or where the service occurs.  
  
 In addition, you can group resources together when responding to service requests.  
  
 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them. These tasks are listed in the order in which they are generally performed.
