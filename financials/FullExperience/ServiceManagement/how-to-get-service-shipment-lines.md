# How to: Get Service Shipment Lines
You can fill in the lines of a service invoice with the selected posted shipment lines for a specific customer. This will enable you to create an invoice for the items that have already been shipped, either from one or several service orders, but not yet been invoiced or consumed.  
  
### To get service shipment lines  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Create a new service invoice.  
  
3.  Fill in the fields on the **General** FastTab.  
  
4.  Choose **Actions**![Action Menu icon](../DesignAndEngineering/media/actionmenuicon.png "actionMenuIcon"), choose **Functions**, and then choose **Get Shipment Lines**.  
  
5.  In the **Get Service Shipment Lines** window, select the relevant service shipment lines, and then choose the **OK** button to insert the lines into the invoice.  
  
 The selected posted shipment lines are inserted into the invoice for the specified customer.
