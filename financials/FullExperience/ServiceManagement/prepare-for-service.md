# Prepare for Service
ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[navnow](../../includes/navnow_md.md)]--> makes it easy to post service orders at any point in your work application's workflow. You can set up your system so that a service technician can post a service order after all information has been filled in. However, it is more typical to permit a service technician to only post shipments. If it better suits your workflow, you can specify that posting occur at any point during the provision of service.  
  
 There is also a built-in Undo function, in case you want to undo a posting.
