# How to: Send Email Messages Manually
If you have not set up a job queue to send email messages to customers or a message cannot be sent in a job queue because of an incorrect email address, you can send the email message manually.  
  
### To send an email message manually  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **View E\-Mail Queue**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Choose the relevant line for which the status is other than **Processed**.  
  
3.  Edit the **To Address** and **Subject Line** fields if necessary.  
  
4.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Queue** group, choose **Send E\-Mail**. A dialog box opens. Choose the **OK** button to confirm sending the message.
