# How to: Create Service Credit Memos
A service credit memo document is typically used when a customer returns an item, but it can also be used to give a customer some compensation or to correct an erroneous invoice.  
  
### To create a service credit memo  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Create a new service credit memo.  
  
3.  Fill in the **No.** field.  
  
4.  In the **Customer No.** field, enter the number of the customer who received the service.  
  
5.  On the **Invoicing** FastTab, you can see the information that was copied from the **Customer** card. If you want to post the credit memo to a different customer than the one specified on the **General** FastTab, enter the number of that customer in the **Bill-to Customer No.** field.  
  
6.  On the General FastTab, in the **Posting Date** and **Document Date** fields, enter a date. These fields are filled in with the system work date automatically. If this date is not suitable, you can change it.  
  
7.  On the credit memo lines, enter information about the items that have been returned or removed, or the compensation that will be given to the customer.
