# How to: Register Service Order Comments

### To register a service order comment  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Open the relevant service order.  
  
3.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Order** group, choose  **Comments** to open the **Service Comment Sheet** window.  
  
4.  In the **Date** field, enter a date.  
  
5.  In the **Comment** field, enter a comment. You can enter a maximum of 80 characters. If you need to enter additional text, go to the next line. You can fill in as many lines as necessary.
