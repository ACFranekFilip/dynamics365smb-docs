# How to: View Gains and Losses on Contracts
A contract gain or loss entry is generated whenever a contract quote is converted to a service contract, when contract lines are added or removed from a service contract, or when a contract is canceled.  
  
 To view contract gains or losses, open one of the following windows.  
  
|**Window**|[!INCLUDE[bp_tabledescription](../ApplicationDesign/includes/bp_tabledescription_md.md)]|
