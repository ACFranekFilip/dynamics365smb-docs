# Fault Reporting
To set up service standards and responses for your company, you can establish how to capture and record fault information and what action to take in response to service items. The ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[demolong](../ApplicationDesign/includes/demolong_md.md)]--> for ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[navnow](../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)]--> provides four options, from which you can select one in the **General** FastTab of the **Service Mgt. Setup** window. Your selection serves as the default implementation for your service application.  
  
 The following table describes the various fault reporting levels.
