# How to: Create Service Items
When you receive an unregistered item for servicing, you can register it as a service item.  
  
### To create a service item  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Items**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  On the **Home** tab, in the **New** group, choose **New** to create a new service item.  
  
3.  In the **No.** field, enter a number for the service item.  
  
     Alternatively, if you have set up number series for service items in the **Service Mgt. Setup** window, you can press Enter to select the next available service item number.  
  
4.  In the **Warranty Starting Date (Parts)** field, you can enter the starting date of the spare parts warranty for this service item. The warranty-related fields are filled in with the default warranty information specified in the **Service Mgt. Setup** window. You can change the default warranty information.  
  
5.  Fill in the rest of the fields on the **General** FastTab.  
  
6.  On the **Customer** FastTab, in the **Customer No.**  field, select the appropriate customer.  
  
7.  Fill in the fields on the **Shipping**, **Vendor**, and **Detail** FastTabs.  
  
 Repeat these steps for each service item you want to create.
