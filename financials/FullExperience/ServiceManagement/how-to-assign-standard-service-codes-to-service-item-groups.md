# How to: Assign Standard Service Codes to Service Item Groups
You may often need to create service documents with service lines that contain similar information. You can have these lines inserted automatically if you set up standard service codes with service lines linked to them, and then assign the codes to service item groups.  
  
### To assign a standard service code to a service item group  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Item Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select a line for a specific service item group. On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Group** group, choose **Std. Serv. Item Gr. Codes** to view the standard service item codes assigned to this service item group.  
  
3.  In the **Code** field, select a service code. Press the Enter key to fill in the **Description** field.  
  
4.  Repeat step 3 for each code you want to assign to the service item group. Each service group can be assigned several standard service codes.  
  
5.  Repeat steps 2 through 4 for all of the service item groups to which you want to assign standard service codes.
