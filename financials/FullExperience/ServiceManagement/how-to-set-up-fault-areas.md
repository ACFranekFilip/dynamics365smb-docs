### To set up fault areas  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Fault Areas**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Create a new fault area   code. On the **Home** tab, in the **New** group, choose **New**.  
  
3.  Fill in the **Code** and **Description** fields.  
  
 Repeat these steps to set up as many fault area codes as you want.
