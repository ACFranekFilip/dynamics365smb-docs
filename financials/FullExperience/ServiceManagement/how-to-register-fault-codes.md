# How to: Register Fault Codes
When the customer brings in a service item for repair, you can assign a fault code to it. This code indicates the nature of the fault and can be used along with the resolution code for future reference on possible methods of repair.  
  
 Depending on the level of fault reporting in your company, you might also need to register fault area codes and symptom codes when you register fault codes. Steps 4 and 5 are only relevant for companies that include fault areas and symptom codes in their fault reporting.  
  
### To register fault codes  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Tasks**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the service task that includes the relevant service item.  
  
3.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Service Tasks** group, choose **Item Worksheet**.  
  
4.  In the **Fault Area Code** field, select the relevant fault area code.  
  
5.  In the **Symptom Code** field, select the relevant symptom code.  
  
6.  In the **Fault Code** field, select the relevant fault code. If an appropriate fault code is not available, you can set up a new fault code.  
  
 Alternatively, you can register both fault and resolution codes using fault\/resolution codes relationships.
