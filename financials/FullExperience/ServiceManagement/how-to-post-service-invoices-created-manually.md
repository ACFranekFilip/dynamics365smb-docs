# How to: Post Service Invoices Created Manually
When you have created an invoice, filled in all the information, and made any required modifications, you can post the invoice.  
  
### To post a service invoice  
  
-   On the invoice, on the **Actions** tab, in the **Posting** group, choose **Post**.  
  
     If you want to print the invoice at the same time as you post, choose **Post and Print** instead.  
  
 A posted service invoice is created along with the corresponding ledger entries.  
  
### To view the posted invoice document  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Posted Service Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the relevant invoice.  
  
     If the **Shipment on Invoice** field in the **Service Mgt. Setup** window is selected, a posted service shipment linked to the invoice is also created.
