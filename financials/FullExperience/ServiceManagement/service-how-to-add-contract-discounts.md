1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Contract Quotes**, and choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the quote you want to add discounts for.  
  
3.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Quote** group, choose **Service Discounts**. The **Contract\/Service Discounts** window opens.  
  
4.  To create a new contract discount, on the **Home** tab, in the **New** group, choose **New**.  
  
5.  Fill in the fields in the **Contract\/Service Discounts** window.
