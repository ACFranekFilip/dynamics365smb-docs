# How to: Assign Skill Codes to Items and Service Items
Servicing some service items may require specific skills. If this is the case, you can assign skill codes to the items that these service items are linked to, or directly to these service items.  
  
 You set up how you use skill codes in the **Resource Skills Option** field, in the **Service Mgt. Setup** window.  
  
### To assign a skill code to an item  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the item you want to assign a skill code to.  
  
3.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Resource** group, choose **Resource**, and then choose  **Resource Skills**.  
  
     The **Type** and **No.** fields will already be filled in with information for the selected item.  
  
4.  In the **Skill Code** field, select the relevant skill code, and then choose the **OK** button.  
  
### To assign a skill code to a service item  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Items**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the service item you want to assign a skill code to.  
  
3.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Serv. Item** group, choose  **Resource Skills**.  
  
     The **Type** and **No.** fields will already be filled in with information for the selected service item.  
  
4.  In the **Skill Code** field, select the relevant skill code, and then choose the **OK** button.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  You can only assign a skill code that differs from the existing ones for the selected item or service item.
