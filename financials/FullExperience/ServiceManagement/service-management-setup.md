# Service Management Setup
In the **Service Mgt. Setup** window, you can decide how you want certain aspects of the Service application area to be managed.  
  
## General FastTab  
 Use this FastTab to control various features that can help you manage your services. You can set up automatic email warnings for response times that you define for your service orders. You can use service zones and resource skills for managing planning, multi\-dimensional fault reporting for service items, define whether you assign one or more service items to a service order, whether ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[navnow](../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)]--> copies comments from a service order to the correspondent service shipment and invoice, and so on.  
  
## Mandatory Fields FastTab  
 Use this FastTab to help you get the information that you require for your service transactions, such as starting and finishing dates for service orders, fault reason codes, and salespersons.  
  
## Defaults FastTab  
 Use this FastTab to define default values for certain information in the Service application area, such as the default response time, default warranty of parts and labor, and the warranty duration for service items.  
  
## Contracts FastTab  
 Use this FastTab to specify certain features that have to be set up to use contracts. You must fill in the **Contract Serv. Ord. Max. Days** field.  
  
## Numbering FastTab  
 Use this FastTab to set up a number series for service items, service orders, service contracts, service contract templates, troubleshooting, service invoices and service credit memos \(both posted and unposted\), posted service shipments, in addition to prepaid documents and loaners. Depending on your set up specification, the next available number is automatically entered or you can enable manual numbering according to the setup of each number series.
