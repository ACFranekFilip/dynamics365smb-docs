# How to: Insert Starting Fees for Service Orders
When working on service items in service orders, you may need to register a starting fee for the service order in general. The following procedure shows how to insert a starting fee in the **Service Lines** window.  
  
 Before you can insert starting fees, you must define which service cost is a starting fee in the **Service Order Starting Fee** field in the **Service Mgt. Setup** window.  
  
### To insert a starting fee for a service order  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Open the relevant service order.  
  
3.  Select a service line. Choose **Actions**![Action Menu icon](../DesignAndEngineering/media/actionmenuicon.png "actionMenuIcon"), choose **Order**, and then choose **Service Lines**. The **Service Lines** window opens.  
  
4.  On the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Insert Starting Fee**.  
  
     A service line of type **Cost** is inserted with the starting fee. The starting fee applies to the service order in general.
