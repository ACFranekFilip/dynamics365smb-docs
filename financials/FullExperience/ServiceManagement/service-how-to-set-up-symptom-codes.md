# How to: Set Up Symptom Codes
You can use the **Symptom Codes** window to set up symptom codes to describe possible symptoms of service item faults. The level of fault reporting in your company determines whether you use symptom codes.  
  
### To set up a symptom code  
  
1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Symptom Codes**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Create a new symptom code. On the **Home** tab, in the **New** group, choose **New**.  
  
3.  Fill in the **Code** and **Description** fields.  
  
 Repeat these steps for each symptom code that you want to create.
