# How to: Set Up Service Contract Account Groups
You can use the **Service Contract Account Groups** window to set up service contract account groups, which are used to group the service contract accounts together for the service invoices of service contracts. You can then assign these groups to your service contracts.  
  
### To set up a service contract account group  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Serv. Contract Account Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Create a new service contract account group. On the **Home** tab, in the **New** group, choose **New**.  
  
3.  Fill in the **Code** and **Description** fields. These fields describe the service account group.  
  
4.  Fill in the **Non-Prepaid Contract Acc.** field. This field contains the general ledger account number for the non-prepaid account.  
  
5.  Fill in the **Prepaid Contract Acc.** field. This field contains the general ledger account number for the prepaid account.  
  
 Repeat all steps for each service contract account group you want to create.
