# How to: Assign Skill Codes to Resources
A resource, for example, a technician, may have specific skills necessary to service specific service items or service item groups. In such cases you must assign the same skill code to the resource and to the item or service item group.  
  
 You set up how you use skill codes in the **Resource Skills Option** field in the **Service Mgt. Setup** window.  
  
### To assign a skill code to a resource  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Resources**, and then choose the related link.Select the resource to which you want to assign a skill code.  
  
2.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Resource** group, choose **Skills**. The **Resource Skills** window opens.  
  
     The **Type** and **No.** fields will already be filled in with information for the resource.  
  
3.  In the **Skill Code** field, select the relevant skill code.
