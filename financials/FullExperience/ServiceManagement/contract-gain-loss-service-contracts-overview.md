# Contract Gain-Loss (Service Contracts) Overview
The **Contract Gain\/Loss \(Service Contracts\)** matrix shows a scrollable summary of contract gain\/loss entries, based on service contracts.  
  
 You fill in the **Contract Gain\/Loss \(Service Contracts\)** window to determine what will be shown in the matrix.  
  
 You can specify which service contracts are included in the window by setting filters in the **Contract No. Filter** field. If you do not set any filters, the window will include information about all service contracts.  
  
 In the **Period Start** field, you can specify the starting date of the period that you want to view.  
  
 You use the **View by** field to select the time interval.  
  
 You use the **View as** field to determine what type of amount will be shown in the period columns: **Net Change**, which displays the net change for each period or **Balance at Date**, which displays the value as of the last day in each period.  
  
 You choose **Show Matrix** to view the matrix. The first three columns contain the time intervals and the total gain\/loss amount for each interval, and the remaining columns contain the total gain\/loss amount for each service contract for the same time intervals.  
  
 When you scroll up and down, the amounts \(in LCY\) are calculated according to the time interval you have selected.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  If you have set the time interval to **Day** and you want to scroll over a long period, you can do it faster by shifting to a larger interval such as **Quarter**. When you have found the desired period, you can shift back to the original interval to see the data in more detail.
