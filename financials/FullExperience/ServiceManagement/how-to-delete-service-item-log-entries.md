### To delete service item log entries  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Item Log**, and then choose the related link.  
  
     Alternatively, you can open the **Service Item Log** for a certain service item from the **Service Item List** window. To do this, select the service item for which you want to see the changes that the program has logged, and then on the **Navigate** tab, in the **History** group, choose **Service Item Log**.
