# How to: Add Contract Lines to Service Contracts or Service Contract Quotes
When a customer purchases a new item and wants to include it in the existing service contract or contract quote, you can register the item as a service item and then add it as a new contract line to the contract or contract quote.  
  
### To add a contract line to a service contract or contract quote  
  
1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Service Contracts**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Open the relevant service contract or service contract quote that you want to add a new contract line for.  
  
3.  On the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Open Contract** to open the service contract or service contract quote for editing.  
  
4.  On the **Invoice Details** FastTab, select the **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** field if you want to change the annual amount and distribute the annual amount difference manually on the contract lines. Otherwise, clear the check box in the **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** field. This will distribute the annual amount difference automatically on the contract lines after you change the annual amount.  
  
5.  On the **Lines** FastTab, insert a proper service item or item, or text description, on each contract line. Alternatively, you may insert contract quote lines. Note that it is possible to create multiple contracts per service item to have it included in different service contracts or contract quotes at the same time.  
  
6.  Verify and correct the numbers in the **Line Discount %**, **Line Discount Amount**, **Response Time**, **Service Period**, and other fields as needed.
