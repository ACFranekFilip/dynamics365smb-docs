# Standard Service Codes
When you perform typical service, you often have to create service documents that use service lines that contain similar information. To optimize the registering of new service lines, you can use standard service codes to have a predefined set of lines entered automatically.  
  
 You can set up any number of standard service codes. Each service code can have an unlimited number of service lines of different types, item, resource, cost, or standard text, linked to it. Service lines for each standard service code can be created in the **Standard Service Code Card** window. You then assign standard service codes to service item groups in the **Standard Serv. Item Gr. Codes** window.  
  
 Later, when you create a service document, you can run the Get Standard Service Codes function to have service lines attached to the specific standard service code entered.
