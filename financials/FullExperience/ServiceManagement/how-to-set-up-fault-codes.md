# How to: Set Up Fault Codes
You can use the **Fault Codes** window to set up fault codes that describe the typical service item faults or the actions taken on service items.  
  
 Depending on the level of fault reporting in your company, you might need to set up fault area codes and symptom codes before you set up fault codes. The final steps are only relevant for companies that include fault areas and symptoms in their fault reporting.  
  
### To set up a fault code  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Fault Codes**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Create a new fault code. On the **Home** tab, in the **New** group, choose **New**.  
  
3.  In the **Fault Area Code** field, select the relevant fault area code.  
  
4.  In the **Symptom Code** field, select the relevant symptom code.  
  
5.  In the **Code** and **Description** fields, enter the code and description of the fault code you want to create.  
  
 Repeat these steps for each fault code that you want to create.
