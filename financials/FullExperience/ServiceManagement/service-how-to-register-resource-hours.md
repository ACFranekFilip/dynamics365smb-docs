# How to: Register Resource Hours
When working on service items in service orders, you need to register the resource hours used for the service. The following procedure shows how to register the resource hours in the **Service Item Worksheet** window.  
  
 You can use the same procedure to register the hours in the **Service Lines** window, which you can open from the Service Order window. Open the relevant service card, and then choose **Actions**![Action Menu icon](../media/actionmenuicon.png "actionMenuIcon"), choose **Order**, and then choose **Service Lines**.  
  
### To register resource hours  
  
1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Service Tasks**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the line that includes the relevant service item. On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Service Tasks** group, choose **Item Worksheet**.  
  
3.  Enter a new service line.  
  
4.  In the **Type** field, select **Resource**.  
  
5.  In the **No.** field, select the relevant resource.  
  
6.  In the **Quantity** field, enter the number of hours used on servicing the service item.  
  
 If the same resource works on all the service items in the service order, you can register the total resource hours for one service item only and then split the resource line to assign the resource hours to the other service items.
