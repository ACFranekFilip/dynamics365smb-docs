# How to: Set Up Service Contract Groups
You can use the **Service Contract Groups** window to set up groups of service contracts that are related in some way.  
  
### To set up a service contract group  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Contract Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Create a new service contract group. On the **Home** tab, in the **New** group, choose **New**.  
  
3.  Fill in the **Code** and **Description** fields.  
  
4.  Select the **Disc. on Contr. Orders Only** field if you want contract or service discounts to be valid only for contract service orders, such as maintenance.  
  
 Repeat all steps for each service contract group you want to set up.
