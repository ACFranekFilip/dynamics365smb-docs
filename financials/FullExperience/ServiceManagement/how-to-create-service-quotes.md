# How to: Create Service Quotes
You can use the **Service Quote** window to create documents where you enter information about a service, such as repairs and maintenance, on service items by customer request. You can use a service quote as a preliminary draft for a service order, and then convert the quote to a service order.  
  
### To create a service quote  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Quotes**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Create a new service quote.  
  
3.  In the **No.** field, enter a number for the service quote.  
  
     Alternatively, if you have set up a number series for service quotes in the **Service Mgt. Setup** window, you can press Enter to select the next available service quote number.  
  
4.  In the **Customer No.**  field, select the relevant customer from the list.  
  
     The customer fields are filled in automatically with information from the **Customer** card.  
  
     If a **Customer** card does not exist for the customer, and you have set up a customer template, you can create the customer within the service quote. Fill in the relevant fields and, on the **Actions** tab, in the **Create** group, choose **Create Customer**.  
  
5.  Depending on the settings on the **Mandatory Fields** FastTab in the **Service Mgt. Setup** window, you may need to fill in the **Service Order Type** field on the **General** FastTab and the **Salesperson Code** field on the **Invoicing** FastTab.  
  
6.  Fill in the service item lines.  
  
7.  Register estimated costs on the service lines.
