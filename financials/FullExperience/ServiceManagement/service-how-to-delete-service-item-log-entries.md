# How to: Delete Service Item Log Entries
You can delete the automatically generated service item log entries, for example, the unnecessary or outdated ones.  
  
### To delete service item log entries  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Item Log**, and then choose the related link.  
  
     Alternatively, you can open the **Service Item Log** for a certain service item from the **Service Item List** window. To do this, select the service item for which you want to see the changes that the program has logged, and then on the **Navigate** tab, in the **History** group, choose **Service Item Log**.  
  
2.  On the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Delete Service Item Log**. The **Delete Service Item Log** batch job request window opens.  
  
3.  Select the service item log entries that you want to delete by setting filters in the batch job request window, and choose the **OK** button.  
  
 After you have deleted the selected service item log entries, they are removed from the **Service Item Log** window.
