# How to: Set Up Service Zones
You can use the **Service Zones** window to set up service zones that split your company's market into geographical regions. When you allocate a resource, for example, a technician, to a service task that is to be performed at the customer site, you can select a resource that is assigned to the same service zone as the customer.  
  
 You set up how you use service zones in the **Service Zones Option** field in the **Service Mgt. Setup** window.  
  
### To set up a service zone  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Zones**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Create a new service zone. On the **Home** tab, in the **New** group, choose **New**.  
  
3.  Fill in the **Code** and **Description** fields.  
  
 Repeat these steps for each service zone you want to create.
