# How to: Check Service Orders Before Posting Them
Before you post a service order, you can check whether there are any errors, or missing or incorrect information. The service order must contain at least one service item line and one service line before you can post the service order.  
  
### To validate service orders prior to posting  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Open the order you want to check.  
  
3.  On the **Actions** tab, in the **Posting** group, choose **Test Report**.  
  
     All parts of the order are validated and the results are presented in a report. If the report indicates any errors or lack of information, you must correct the problem. You can then print a new test report.
