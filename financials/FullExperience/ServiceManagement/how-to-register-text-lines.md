# How to: Register Text Lines
When registering service lines for service orders, you may want to register lines with standard texts, for example, to make a comment about the line above. The following procedure shows how to register text lines in the **Service Item Worksheet** window.  
  
### To register text lines  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Tasks**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the line that includes the relevant service item. On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Service Tasks** group, choose **Item Worksheet**.  
  
3.  On the **Lines** FastTab, enter a new service line.  
  
4.  In the **Type** field, select **Blank**.  
  
5.  In the **No.** field, select the relevant text. The description of the standard text is copied into the **Description** field.  
  
     Alternatively, you can also leave the **No.** field blank and enter the text in the **Description** field.  
  
 You can use a similar procedure to register text lines in the **Service Lines** window, which you open from the **Service Order** window.  
  
### To register text lines from a service order  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Open the service order you want to register text lines for.  
  
3.  Select the line that includes the relevant service item. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose **Actions**![Action Menu icon](../DesignAndEngineering/media/actionmenuicon.png "actionMenuIcon"), choose **Order**, and then choose **Service Lines**.  
  
     If the service order requires a link between service and service items, you have to select the **Lines Not Item Related** option in the **Selection Filter** field if you want the text lines to apply to the service order in general.  
  
4.  Enter a new service line.  
  
 Repeat these steps for each text line you want to register.
