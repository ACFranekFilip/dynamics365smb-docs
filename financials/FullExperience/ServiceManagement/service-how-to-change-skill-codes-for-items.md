# How to: Change Skill Codes for Items
You may want to change the skill codes assigned to items, for example, changing **PC** to **PCS**. The procedure for changing skill codes is similar to the process of assigning skill codes.  
  
### To change skill codes for an item  
  
1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the service item you want to assign a skill code to.  
  
3.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Resource** group, choose **Resource**, and then choose **Resource Skills**. The **Resource Skills** window opens.  
  
4.  On the line with the code to be changed, in the **Skill Code** field, select the relevant skill code.  
  
5.  If the item has associated service items, a dialog box opens with the following two options:  
  
    -   Change the skill codes to the selected value: Select this option if you want to replace the old skill code with the new one on all the related service items.  
  
    -   Delete the skill codes or update their relation: Select this option if you want to change the skill code on this item only. The skill code on the related service items will be reassigned, that is, the **Assigned From** field will be updated.
