# How to: Insert Service Contract Lines into Service Contracts or Contract Quotes
You may need to insert the contract or contract quote lines to register service items in the service contract or service contract quote that are already included in a different service contract or service contract quote.  
  
### To insert a contract line into a service contract or service contract quote  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Contracts** or **Service Contract Quotes**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Open the relevant service contract or service contract quote that you want to insert lines into.  
  
3.  On the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Open Contract** to open the contract for editing.  
  
4.  On the **Invoice Details** FastTab, select the check box in the **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** field if you want to change the annual amount and distribute the annual amount difference manually on the contract lines. Otherwise, clear the check box in the **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** field to distribute the annual amount difference automatically on the contract lines after you change the annual amount.  
  
5.  On the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Select Contract Lines** or **Select Contract Quote Lines**. The **Contract Line Selection** window opens, showing all the service items registered to the customer. If a ship-to address is specified in the contract or contract quote, it will be displayed in this window.  
  
6.  Select the service items you want to include in the service contract or service contract quote, and then choose the **OK** button.  
  
 Repeat these steps for each service item you want to include in the service contract or service contract quote.
