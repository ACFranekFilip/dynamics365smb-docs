# How to: Insert Travel Fees for Service Items
When working on service items in service orders, you may need to register travel fees for the service of specific service items. The following procedure shows how to insert fees for travel to the service zone of the customer in the service order in the **Service Item Worksheet** window.  
  
 Before you can insert travel fees, you must set up service costs for travel to specific service zones.  
  
### To insert a travel fee for a service item  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Tasks**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the line that includes the relevant service item. On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Service Tasks** group, choose **Item Worksheet**.  
  
3.  On the **Lines** FastTab, select the relevant line. Choose **Actions**![Action Menu icon](../DesignAndEngineering/media/actionmenuicon.png "actionMenuIcon"), choose **Functions**, and then choose **Insert Travel Fee**.  
  
     A service line is inserted with the travel fee to the service zone where the customer in the service order is located. The travel fee applies to the selected service item.
