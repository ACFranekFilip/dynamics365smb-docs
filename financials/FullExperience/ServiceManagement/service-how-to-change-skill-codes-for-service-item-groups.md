# How to: Change Skill Codes for Service Item Groups
You may want to change the skill codes assigned to service item groups, for example, change **PC** to **PCS**. The procedure for changing skill codes is similar to the process of assigning skill codes.  
  
### To change skill codes for a service item group  
  
1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Service Item Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the service item group to which you want to assign a skill code. On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Resource** group, choose **Resource**, and then choose **Resource Skills.** The **Resource Skills** window opens.  
  
3.  On the line with the code to be changed, in the **Skill Code** field, select the relevant skill code.  
  
4.  If the service item group has associated items or service items, a dialog box opens with the following two options:  
  
    -   Change the skill codes to the selected value: Select this option if you want to replace the old skill code with the new one on all the related items and service items.  
  
    -   Delete the skill codes or update their relation: Select this option if you want to change the skill code on this service item group only. The skill code on the related items and service items will be reassigned, that is, the **Assigned From** field will be updated.
