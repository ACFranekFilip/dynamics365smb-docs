### To set up a service contract group  
  
1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Service Contract Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Create a new service contract group. On the **Home** tab, in the **New** group, choose **New**.  
  
3.  Fill in the **Code** and **Description** fields.  
  
4.  Select the **Disc. on Contr. Orders Only** field if you want contract or service discounts to be valid only for contract service orders, such as maintenance.
