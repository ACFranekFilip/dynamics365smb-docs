# How to: Batch Post Service Orders
If you have set up a large number of service orders, it is advantageous to post them in a batch job. You can have them posted at any convenient time.  
  
### To batch post service orders  
  
1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  On the **Actions** tab, in the **Posting** group, choose **Post Batch**. The **Batch Post Service Orders** batch job request window opens.  
  
     When you use the **Batch Post Service Orders** batch job, it does not matter which service order you work from.  
  
3.  You can set a filter to select specific service order numbers or an interval of order numbers for the batch job to process.  
  
4.  Choose the **OK** button to start the batch job.
