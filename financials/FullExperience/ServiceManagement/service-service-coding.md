# Service Coding
To successfully create a service management implementation, you should decide up front what your standard service offerings and scenarios will be. [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)] has features to make this easy.  
  
 For example, you can set up a group of service codes to describe what service items are part of your solution. Each code represents a specific group of service lines that typically go together. A technician filling out a service order has to only select the appropriate service code and have the associated information automatically filled in, which helps standardize information gathering.  
  
 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.
