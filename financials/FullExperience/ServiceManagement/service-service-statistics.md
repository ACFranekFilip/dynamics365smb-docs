# Service Statistics
The service statistics feature lets you gain a quick overview of the contents of all of a service document, which includes quotes, invoices, or credit memos, the details on the specific service lines, and the items in the document. The feature enables you to see the amounts that will be posted if you will post the service document.  
  
 The statistical information is displayed in the service statistics window for the corresponding document. You can open the relevant statistics window from the quote, invoice, or credit memo document. For each of these document types, on the **Home** tab, in the **Process** group, choose **Statistics**. For example, from the  **Service Invoices** window, on the **Home** tab, in the **Process** group, choose **Statistics**. The **Service Statistics** window provides statistical data that is grouped on three FastTabs: **General**, **Service Line**, and **Customer**. These FastTabs show information such as quantity, amount, VAT, cost, profit, and customer credit limit. The amounts in the window are in the currency of the service document, unless otherwise indicated.  
  
## General FastTab  
 Use this FastTab to see totals of the service document. This includes the total amount on the service lines \(including and excluding VAT\), VAT part, cost, and profit on the service lines. The FastTab also displays item-related information about the items indicated on the service lines, such as weight, volume, and the quantity of parcels.  
  
## Service Line FastTab  
 Use this FastTab to analyze the information presented on the **General** FastTab by the types of service lines that are included in the relevant service document. The amounts are shown separately for:  
  
-   Items  
  
-   Resources  
  
-   Costs and general ledger accounts  
  
## Customer FastTab  
 Use this FastTab to see the balance on the customer's account, in addition to the maximum credit that can be endued to the customer that you created the service document for.  
  
 The lines in the lower part of the **Service Statistics** window show the VAT details on the amounts in the service document.
