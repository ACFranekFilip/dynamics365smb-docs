# How to: Use the Dispatch Board
You may often need to see the list of service orders or service quotes that meet certain requirements to be able to perform specific actions with them one by one. For example, you may need to allocate resources to service orders that belong to a specific customer.  
  
### To see an overview of service orders and service quotes  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Dispatch Board**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **Document Filter** field, select the type of the documents you want to see. There are three options: **Order**, **Quote**, and **All**.  
  
3.  If you want to get a list of documents that contain service tasks a certain resource or resource group is allocated to, fill in the **Resource Filter** and **Resource Group Filter** fields and press Enter.  
  
4.  If you want to get a list of documents with a certain response date or response dates within a certain date period, fill in the **Response Date Filter** field and press Enter.  
  
5.  If you want to get a list of documents with a specified allocation state or document status, fill in the **Allocation Filter\/Status Filter** field and press Enter.  
  
6.  If you want to get a list of documents that belong to a certain contract, customer, or zone, fill in the **Contract Filter\/Customer Filter\/Zone Filter** field and press Enter.  
  
7.  Select a certain line that corresponds to a relevant service order or service quote. On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Dispatch Board** group, choose **Show Document**.  
  
     The **Service Order** or **Service Quote** window opens, and you can work with the document. To return back to the **Dispatch Board** window, choose the **OK** button.
