# How to: Set Up Contract Specific Service Hours
You can use the **Service Hours** window to set up specific service hours for the customer that owns the service contract. Service hours are used to calculate the response date and time for service orders and quotes that belong to the service contract.  
  
 If you do not set up specific service hours for the service contract, the default service hours for service contracts are used.  
  
### To set up contract specific service hours  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Contracts**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Open the relevant service contract you want to set up specific service hours for.  
  
3.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Contract** group, choose **Service Hours**. The **Service Hours** window opens.  
  
4.  If you want to set up service hours based on default service hours, in the **Service Hours** window, on the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Copy Default Service Hours**.  
  
5.  Edit the fields in the service hours entries. Insert or delete entries to set up the service hours for the contract. Note that the fields **Day**, **Starting Time** and **Ending Time** are required for each line.  
  
6.  If you want the service hours to be valid from a specific date, fill in the **Starting Date** field.  
  
7.  If you want the service hours to be valid on holidays, select the check box in the **Valid on Holidays** field.  
  
8.  Choose the **OK** button.
