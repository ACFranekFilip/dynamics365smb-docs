# How to: View the Service Email Queue
When the status of service orders is updated to **Finished**, and the customer in the order is to be notified by email message, an entry is added to the service email queue. If you have set up a job queue to send email messages, the messages are sent to the customers.  
  
### To view the service email queue  
  
-   In the **Search** box, enter **View E-Mail Queue**, and then choose the related link.  
  
     In the list, you can see the status of each entry in the queue and the relevant subject line of the email message that will be sent.
