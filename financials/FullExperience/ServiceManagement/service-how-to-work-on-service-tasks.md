# How to: Work on Service Tasks
After you have created a service order or service quote, registered service item lines, and allocated resources to the service items in the order or quote, you can start repairing and maintaining the service items.  
  
### To work on a service task  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Tasks**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  If you want a list of service tasks a certain resource or resource group is allocated to, fill in the **Resource Filter** or **Resource Group Filter** field and press Enter.  
  
3.  If you want a list of service tasks with a certain response date or response dates within a certain time period, fill in the **Response Date Filter** field and press Enter.  
  
4.  If you want a list of service tasks with a certain allocation status or repair status, fill in the **Allocation Status Filter** or **Repair Status Code Filter** field and press Enter.  
  
5.  Select the service task you want to work on. On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Service Tasks** group, choose **Item Worksheet**. The **Service Item Worksheet** window opens.  
  
6.  Register standard texts, spare parts, resource hours, and costs as appropriate using the corresponding options in the **Type** field:  \<Blank\>, **Item**, **Resource**, and **Cost**.  
  
7.  In the **Repair Status** field, select the appropriate status.  
  
     Fill in the **Repair Status** field with the **Finished** or **Partly Serviced** status if the service item has been completely serviced or another resource will continue servicing. The **Finished** or **Reallocation Needed** status is specified automatically for the allocation entry corresponding to the service item.
