# Service Line Price Adjustments
In the **Service Line Price Adjmt.** window, you can see information about the service lines that your price adjustment groups will adjust.  
  
 In this window, you can preview the price adjustments and modify them if it is needed, before these price adjustments will take effect.  
  
 You can, for example, set up price adjustment groups that adjust service lines that include any spare parts, that adjust the lines for a particular resource, or that adjust the lines for all spare parts with a particular combination of general business and product posting groups.
