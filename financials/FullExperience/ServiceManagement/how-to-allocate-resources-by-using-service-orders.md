# How to: Allocate Resources by Using Service Orders
After you have created and filled in a service order or service quote, you can allocate resources, for example, technicians, to perform service tasks registered as service item lines in the document.  
  
### To allocate a resource using a service order  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the relevant service order, and on the **Home** tab, in the **Manage** group, choose **Edit**.  
  
3.  Select the service item line corresponding to the service task you want to allocate a resource to.  
  
4.  On the **Lines** toolbar, on the **Line** menu, choose **Resource Allocations**. The **Resource Allocations** window opens.  
  
5.  In the **Resource Allocations** window, select a nonactive allocation entry with the service task you want to allocate the resource to. If the nonactive allocation entry does not exist, you can create a new one.  
  
6.  To create a new nonactive allocation entry, on the **Actions** tab, choose **New**.  
  
7.  Specify the service task by filling in the **Service Item No.** field on the same line.  
  
8.  In the **Resource No.** field, select the relevant resource. If the resource is a member of a resource group, the number of the resource group is entered automatically into the **Resource Group No.** field.  
  
9. Fill in the **Allocation Date** and **Allocated Hours** fields. The **Status** field is set to **Active**. This means that the resource is allocated to the service task.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  For a service item in a service order, there can only be Active allocation entries with one resource or resource group at a time.
