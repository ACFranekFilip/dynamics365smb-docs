You can use the **Service Shelves** window to set up service shelves that identify where service items are stored while they are in the repair shop.  
  
 You assign service shelves to service items in the **Service Order** window and in the **Service Item Worksheet** window.  
  
### To set up a service shelf  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Shelves**, and then choose the related link.
