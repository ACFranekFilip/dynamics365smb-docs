# Plan Service
With [!INCLUDE[navnow](../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)], you can set up the standard tasks that you need to fulfill your customer service requirements. To successfully do this, you have to determine what service offerings your service organization is supporting. In addition, you may want to establish a framework within which to set work levels for service workers.  
  
 After you do this, you can map what skills a particular service item requires and which employees have those skills. This makes it easy to create service orders and manage job assignments. You can also manage how many hours a service typically takes, repair status, and employee work hours.  
  
 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them. These tasks are listed in the order in which they are generally performed.
