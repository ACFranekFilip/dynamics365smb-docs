# How to: View Service Statistics
When you have created a service document, that is, a quote, invoice, or credit memo, and filled in the lines, you can see the resulting totals in the **Service Statistics** window for the relevant document.  
  
### To view service statistics  
  
1.  Create a service quote, invoice, or credit memo. Fill in the header and the lines in the document with the relevant information.  
  
2.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Quote**, **Invoice**, or **Cr. Memo** group, choose **Statistics**.  
  
     The **Service Statistics** window for the document opens.  
  
3.  On the **General** FastTab, you can see summary information about the entire service document, such as the total amount, VAT, cost, profit, and so on.  
  
4.  On the **Service Line** FastTab, you can see the amounts on different kinds of service lines in the service document. The amounts are shown separately for items, resources, costs, and general ledger accounts.  
  
5.  On the **Customer** FastTab, you can view basic accounting information for the customer that you created the service document for.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If something must be corrected, you can return to the service document window and make the necessary changes.
