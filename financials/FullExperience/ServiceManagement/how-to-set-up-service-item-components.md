# How to: Set Up Service Item Components
A service item can consist of several components, which can be replaced with spare parts when the item is serviced. These components are set up in the **Service Item Component List** window.  
  
### To set up service item components  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Items**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Open the service item for which you want to set up components.  
  
3.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Serv. Item** group, choose **Components**. The **Service Item Component List** window opens.  
  
4.  Add a new component. On the **Home** tab, in the **New** group, choose **New**.  
  
5.  In the **Type** field, select **Service Item** if the component itself is a registered service item. Otherwise, select **Item**.  
  
6.  In the **No.** field, select the item or service item that is a component of the service item.  
  
7.  Fill in the other fields in the **Service Item Component List** window.  
  
 Repeat these steps for each component you want to set up for the service item.
