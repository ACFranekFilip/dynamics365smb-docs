# How to: Register Service Contract Comments
You can use the **Service Comment Sheet** window to register comments on service contracts or service contract quotes.  
  
 The following procedure uses a service contract as an example, but the same procedure can apply to service contract quotes.  
  
### To register service contract comments  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Contracts**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Open the relevant service contract.  
  
3.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Contract** group, choose **Comments**. The **Service Comment Sheet** window opens.  
  
4.  In the **Date** field, enter a date.  
  
5.  In the **Comment** field, enter a comment. You can enter a maximum of 80 characters, including spaces. If you need to enter additional text, go to the next line. You can fill in as many lines as necessary.
