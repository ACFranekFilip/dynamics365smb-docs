# Selecting a Language
ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[navnow](../../includes/navnow_md.md)]--> is multilanguage enabled. You can therefore change the language that the application uses.  
  
## To change the application language  
  
1.  Choose the app menu, and then choose **Select Language** to open the **Select Language** window.  
  
2.  In the **Language** field, select the language that you want ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[navnow](../../includes/navnow_md.md)]--> to use.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  For other ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[navnow](../../includes/navnow_md.md)]--> clients, you select Language and other settings using the **My Settings** page.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The application language only affects application text, such as window and field names. It does not affect the language of data that you enter.  
>   
>  ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[navnow](../../includes/navnow_md.md)]--> only supports a single character set for data. Therefore, some characters may not be supported by your installation, and you may experience problems when retrieving data that was entered using a different character set. For example, your installation may support only English and Russian characters. If you enter data in a different language, then it may not be stored correctly. Contact your system administrator to make sure you understand which languages are supported by your installation.
