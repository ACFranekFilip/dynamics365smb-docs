# How to: Make Windows Editable
ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[navnow](../../includes/navnow_md.md)]--> lets you work with windows in three different modes: View, Edit, and New. The mode appears in the window caption, before the window name. For example, **View - Customer Card - 10000 The Cannon Group PLC**.  
  
 This topic describes how to switch from view mode to edit mode.  
  
### To edit a card or document  
  
-   If you are in a card or document window in view mode and want to edit data in the window:  
  
     On the **Home** tab, in the **Manage** group, choose **Edit**.  
  
-   If you are in a list window and want to open one record from the list:  
  
     Select the line with the record that you want to edit, on the **Home** tab, in the **Manage** group, choose **Edit**.  
  
### To edit a list  
  
-   Some lists can be made editable, such as the **Currencies** list, or the **General Posting Setup** window. To switch a list to edit mode:  
  
     On the **Home** tab, in the **Manage** group, choose **Edit List**.  
  
 You can now edit data on an existing line or insert a new line.
