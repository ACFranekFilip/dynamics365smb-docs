# Sorting
The sorting function makes it easy for you to get a quick overview of your data. A sorted list can be saved using the **Save View As…** functionality which is found by choosing the page title.  
  
 If you have many customers, for example, you can choose to sort your customers by:  
  
-   Customer No.  
  
-   Search Name  
  
-   Customer Posting Group  
  
-   Currency Code  
  
-   Country Region Code  
  
-   General Business Posting Group  
  
-   Name, Address, or City  
  
-   VAT Registration No.  
  
 You can choose to sort on a single column and in ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[nav_windows](../../includes/nav_windows_md.md)]--> you can use the following shortcuts for sorting:  
  
|Shortcut|Description|  
|--------------|-----------------|  
|Left-click|Left-click on a column to sort a column ascending, then left-click again to toggle between ascending and descending.|  
|Shift+left-click|On multiple column headers, the columns will all be sorted in the same ascending or descending direction.|  
|Shift+double-click|If you are sorting on multiple column headers using Shift+left-click, you can use Shift+double-click on the first column you clicked on and this will toggle ascending/descending direction of all the columns included in the sorting.|  
  
> [!WARNING]  
>  Sorting is not supported on images, BLOB fields, FlowFilters, and fields that do not belong to a table.  
  
## Sorting Lists and Journal Lines  
 The following example shows how to sort a list of customers by name.

 The same steps apply to journals, such as the **Planning Worksheet** window.  
  
## Sorting Document Lines  
 The following example shows how to sort lines on a sales order.  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link. Select a sales order.  
  
2.  On the sales order, choose the **Lines** FastTab, choose any column to sort on, right-click the column header, and select **Sort ascending** or **Sort descending**.
