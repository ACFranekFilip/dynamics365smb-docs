# How to: Create Notes and Notifications
The ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[navnow](../../includes/rtc_md.md)]--> enables you to attach a note to any record in the application. For example, if you have extra information about a sales order that does not fit in any of the fields on the sales order, you can write a note. Then it will be available on the sales order window for you and any of your colleagues that look at the sales order.  
  
 You can have the note appear as a notification on your colleague's Role Center—or even on your own Role Center, as a reminder.  
  
 When you or your colleague reads the notification, they can open the sales order just by double-clicking the notification.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  You can only select one recipient of the note.  
  
### To create a note and send it as a notification  
  
1.  Open the relevant record (for example, a sales order, item or customer card).  
  
2.  If **Notes** is not visible on the page, then you can customize the page to display the Notes FactBox.  
  
3.  In **Notes**, click **Click here to create a new note**, and then click again to place the cursor in the text box.  
  
4.  Type your note.  
  
     You can enter a maximum of 30 lines of text in the note.  
  
5.  In the **To** field, enter a user ID (your own or someone else’s) to indicate who the note is for.  
  
6.  Select the **Notify** field if you want to send a notification to the user in the **To** field.  
  
     If **Notify** is selected, the note will be sent as a notification to the user's **My Notifications** on the Role Center.  
  
7.  Click **Save**.
