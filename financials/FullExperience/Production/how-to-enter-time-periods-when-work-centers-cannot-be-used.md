# How to: Enter Time Periods When Work Centers Cannot Be Used
The calendar for the work center is calculated from the entries of the assigned shop calendar and the calendar absence entries of the work center.  
  
 The result of the calculation is entries in the calendar for the work center.  
  
### To enter time periods when work centers cannot be used  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Work Centers**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Open the relevant **Work Center** card from the list.  
  
3.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Planning** group, choose **Absence**.  
  
4.  Fill in the **Date**, **Starting Time**, and **Ending Time** fields for the planned absence.  
  
     These calendar absence entries are only valid for the selected work center.  
  
5.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Absence** group, choose **Update** to calculate the calendar entries for the work center. This must be done every time you enter calendar entries.
