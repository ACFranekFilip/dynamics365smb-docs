# How to: Set Up Shop Calendars
It is possible to set up many different calendars. A calendar is then assigned to the individual capacity.  
  
 Every calendar day is assigned a work shift. Normally, one work shift is used for each calendar. However, multiple work shifts can be entered on one calendar.  
  
### To set up shop calendars  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Shop Calendars**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Fill in a code and a name for each calendar you wish to create.  
  
3.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Shop Cal.** group, choose **Working Days**.  
  
4.  Enter the days of the week, starting and ending times, and a work shift code for this shop calendar.  
  
 After you have defined the working days for this calendar, you must define the exceptions, such as holidays and company holidays.
