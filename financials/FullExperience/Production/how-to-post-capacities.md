1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Capacity Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Fill in the **Posting Date** and **Document No.** fields.  
  
3.  In the **Type** field, enter the type of the capacity, either **Machine Center** or **Work Center**, that you are posting.  
  
4.  In the **No.** field, enter the number of the machine center or work center.  
  
5.  Enter the relevant data in the other fields, such as **Starting Time**, **Ending Time**, **Quantity**, and **Scrap**.  
  
6.  ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[bp_ribbonxml](../Token/bp_ribbonxml_md.md)]-->On the **Action** tab, in the **Posting** group, choose **Post** to post the capacities.
