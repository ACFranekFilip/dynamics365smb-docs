# How to: Assign Tools to Operations
You can assign any tools to a routing line, that is, an operation. The assigned tools specify which tool is to be used to process the operation. This specification is used for special tools, precision tools, and quality measures.  
  
### To assign a tool to an operation  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Routings**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Open the **Routing** card that you want to update. Select the line you want to process.  
  
3.  On the **Lines** FastTab, choose **Actions**![Action Menu icon](../FullExperience/media/actionmenuicon.png "actionMenuIcon"), choose **Operation**, and then choose **Tools**.  
  
4.  Fill in the fields in the **Routing Tools** window.  
  
5.  Choose the **OK** button to exit the window. The entered values are copied and assigned to the operation.
