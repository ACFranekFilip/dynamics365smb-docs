# How to: Set Up Machine Centers
The machine centers are used as the lowest capacity level. No further subdivision is possible. You must therefore use machine centers for either single machines or a number of identical machines that do not need to be distinguished any further.  
  
### To set up a machine center  
  
1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Machine Centers**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Create a new **Machine Center** card. On the **Home** tab, in the **New** group, choose **New**.  
  
3.  Enter a new machine center number. If you have set up a default machine center number series, press the Enter key to fill in this field with the next number in the series.  
  
4.  Fill in the other fields. The **No.** and **Work Center No.** fields are required.  
  
5.  Close the window.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The **Work Center No.** field is used to link the machine center to a work center.
