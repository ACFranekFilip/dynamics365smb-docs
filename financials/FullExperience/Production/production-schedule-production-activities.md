# Schedule Production Activities
Before starting actual production activities, it is often necessary to fine schedule the rough-cut production schedule that resulted from [Operations Planning](../operations-planning.md). The main part of this work is to fit planned operations into the larger matrix of planned and started operations on multiple production resources along a time line. As a part of constantly maintaining a balanced production schedule, the work may also involve finding ways to better utilize resources to adjust for unforeseen changes in capacity.  
  
 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them. These tasks are listed in the order in which they are generally performed.  
  
|**To**|**See**|  
|------------|-------------|  
|View a list of production orders to schedule or control.|Released Production Order|  
|View the sum of setup and run time allocated for one production order routing to perform a specific operation, or view the sum of time allocated for one machine\/work center to perform operations for multiple production orders.|Prod. Order Capacity Need|  
|Learn how to use the **Work Center Load** window to fine schedule production activities \(works similarly for machine centers\).|Work Center Load|  
|View the load on a work center over time \(works similarly for machine centers\).|[How to: Display the Load on Work Centers](../how-to-display-the-load-on-work-centers.md)|  
|View a report of loads on machine and work centers.|Work Center Load|  
|View a list of work centers that are overloaded, shown by efficiency bars \(works similarly for machine centers\).|Work Center Load - Bar|  
|Suspend the strict capacity need calculation to allow one or more operations to extend into unavailable shop calendar time.|Schedule Manually|  
|Get an overview of operations that are currently outsourced and do not require internal scheduling.|Subcontractor - Dispatch List|
