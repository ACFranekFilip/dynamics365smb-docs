# Structure of the Capacity
The program distinguishes between three types of capacities. These are arranged hierarchically. Each level contains the subordinate levels.  
  
 The top level is the work center group.  
  
 Work centers are assigned to the work center groups. Every work center can only belong to one work center group.  
  
 You can assign various machine centers to every work center. A machine center may only belong to one work center.  
  
 Planned capacity of a work center consists of the availability of the corresponding machine centers and the additional planned availability of the work center.  
  
 The planned availability of the work center group is thus the sum of all corresponding availabilities of the machine centers and work centers.  
  
 The availability is stored in calendar entries.
