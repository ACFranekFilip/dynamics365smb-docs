# How to: Reserve Items for Production Order Lines
You can reserve items for production orders. You have to distinguish between production order lines and production order components.  
  
 In the following procedure, a firm planned production order is used.  
  
### To reserve an item for a production order line  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Firm Planned Prod. Order**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Open the firm planned production order you want to reserve items for.  
  
3.  Select the relevant production order line.  
  
4.  On the **Lines** FastTab, choose **Actions**![Action Menu icon](../DesignAndEngineering/media/actionmenuicon.png "actionMenuIcon"), choose **Functions**, and then choose **Reserve**.  
  
5.  Select the **Sales Line, Order** line, and then on the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Reserve from Current Line**.  
  
 The quantity you entered in the firm planned production order line is now reserved.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If item tracking lines exist for the sales order, the reservation system will take you through additional steps. For more information, see [How to: Reserve Item\-Tracked Items](../DesignAndEngineering/how-to-reserve-item-tracked-items.md).
