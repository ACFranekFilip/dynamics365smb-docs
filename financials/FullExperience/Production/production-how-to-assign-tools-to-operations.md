1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Routings**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Open the **Routing** card that you want to update. Select the line you want to process.  
  
3.  On the **Lines** FastTab, choose **Actions**![Action Menu icon](../media/actionmenuicon.png "actionMenuIcon"), choose **Operation**, and then choose **Tools**.
