# How to: Post Output Quantity
The output quantity represents the work progress in the form of the finished quantity.  
  
 When you post output quantity on the last operation, the inventory is updated automatically.  
  
### To post output quantity  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Output Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **Posting Date** field, enter a posting date.  
  
3.  In the **Production Order No.** field, enter the production order number.  
  
4.  In the **Item No.** field, select the item number.  
  
5.  In the **Operation No.** field, enter the operation number.  
  
6.  In the **Output Quantity** field, enter the product quantity.  
  
7.  If the operation has been completed, select the **Finished** field.  
  
8.  If the warehouse location where the items should be put away uses bins but does not require put\-away processing,  assign a bin code to the journal line to specify where the items should be placed in the warehouse. For more information, see [How to: Assign Bin Codes on Journal Lines](../Production/how-to-assign-bin-codes-on-journal-lines.md).  
  
9. On the **Actions** tab, in the **Posting** group, choose **Post** to post the operations. The output quantity will be posted. The item is now available for shipping.
