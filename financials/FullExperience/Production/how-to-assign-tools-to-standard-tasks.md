# How to: Assign Tools to Standard Tasks
You can assign any tools to standard tasks. The assigned tools specify which tool is to be used for processing the task. The specification is useful for special tools, precision tools, and quality measures.  
  
### To assign a tool to a standard task  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Standard Tasks**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the standard task to be processed.  
  
3.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Std. Task** group, choose **Tools**. Fill in the fields.  
  
4.  Choose the **OK** button to close the window.  
  
 The entered values are copied and assigned to the standard task.
