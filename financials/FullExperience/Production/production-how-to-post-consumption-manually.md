# How to: Post Consumption Manually
If the flushing method is **Manual**, you must post the components manually, using a consumption journal.  
  
### To post consumption manually  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Consumption Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Fill in the fields with the production order data and the consumption data.  
  
     If the warehouse location where the components are stored is set up to use bins but does not require pick processing, assign a bin code to the journal line to indicate where the items should be taken from in the warehouse. For more information, see [How to: Assign Bin Codes on Journal Lines](../how-to-assign-bin-codes-on-journal-lines.md).  
  
3.  On the **Actions** tab, in the **Posting** group, choose **Post** to post the consumption.
