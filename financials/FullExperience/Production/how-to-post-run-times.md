# How to: Post Run Times
The run time represents work progress in the form of the necessary working time.  
  
### To post run time  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Output Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **Posting Date** field, enter a posting date.  
  
3.  In the **Production Order No.** field, enter a production order number.  
  
4.  In the **Item No.** field, enter an item number.  
  
5.  In the **Operation No.** field, enter an operation number.  
  
6.  In the **Run Time** field, enter the time necessary for processing the operation.  
  
7.  In the **Output Quantity** field, enter the quantity produced in the period.  
  
8.  If the operation is completed, select the **Finished** field.  
  
9. If the warehouse location where the items should be put away uses bins but does not require put-away processing, assign a bin code to the journal line to specify where the items should be placed in the warehouse. For more information, see [How to: Assign Bin Codes on Journal Lines](../how-to-assign-bin-codes-on-journal-lines.md).  
  
10. On the **Actions** tab, in the **Posting** group, choose **Post** to post the operations. Choose the **Yes** button.
