# Production
When [production orders](../Production/about-production-orders.md) are planned and created as a part of [Operations Planning](../OperationsPlanning/operations-planning.md), shop floor staff can proceed to fine schedule the activities, pull the required material, and output finished goods. In order to convert material into end items, a complete set of production resources must exist. This setup work is also the responsibility of the production department and is described as the first set of tasks in Established Production Resources below.  
  
 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them. These tasks are listed in the order in which they are generally performed.
