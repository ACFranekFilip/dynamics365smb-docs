# How to: Review and Customize Existing Database Data
As you create a configuration package for a solution, you can view and customize the available database data to suit your customer needs. The database table has to have an associated page.  
  
### To customize data in the database  
  
1.  In the configuration worksheet, identify the tables whose data that you want to view or customize.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  Make sure that each table has a page ID assigned to it. For standard ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[navnow](../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)]--> tables, this value is automatically filled in. For custom tables, you have to provide the ID.  
  
2.  On the **Actions** tab, in the **Show** group, choose **Database Data**.  
  
     The ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[navnow](../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)]--> window for the page opens.  
  
3.  Review the available information. Modify it as necessary by deleting records that are not relevant or by adding new ones.
