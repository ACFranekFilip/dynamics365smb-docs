# Microsoft Dynamics NAV Change Log
The change log in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] logs changes that are made to data in the tables that you track. In the change log, entries are chronologically ordered and show changes that are made to the fields on the specified tables.  
  
 The change log collects all changes that are made to the table. For more information, see [How to: Enable the Change Log](../how-to-enable-the-change-log.md).
