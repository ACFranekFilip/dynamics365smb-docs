# How to: Import Customer Data
After the customer data has been entered in the data migration files in Excel, you import the files into FIX INCLUDE HERE<!--FIX INCLUDE HERE<!--[!INCLUDE[navnow](../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)] --> -->.  
  
### To import customer data  
  
1.  Open the **Migration Overview** window.  
  
2.  Select the table for which you want to import data.  
  
3.  You can import the date into a table from Excel.  
  
     On the **Tables** FastTab, choose Excel, and then choose **Import from Excel** and save the file.  
  
4.  Locate and open the file that you want from which you want to import data to [!INCLUDE[navnow](../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)].  
  
 Data from the file is imported into the configuration package tables. In the **No. of Package Records** field, you can see the number of records that have been imported. In addition, you can see the number of migration errors.
