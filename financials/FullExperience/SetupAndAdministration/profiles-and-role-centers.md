# Profiles and Role Centers
Profiles are collections of ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[navnow](../../includes/navnow_md.md)]--> users who share the same Role Center. A Role Center is a type of page on which you can place different parts. Each part is a container in which you can host other pages or pre-defined system parts, such as an Outlook part or parts for adding tasks, notifications, or notes.  
  
 The user interface of Role Centers and all other pages can be customized. For more information, see [Customize the User Interface](../FullExperience/customize-the-user-interface.md).  
  
 The concept of UI customization in ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[dyn_nav](../../includes/dyn_nav_md.md)]--> is divided in two:  
  
-   Configuration, performed by the administrator  
  
-   Personalization, performed by users  
  
 The administrator configures the user interface for multiple users by customizing the user interface for a profile that the users are assigned to. For more information, see [Configure the User Interface](../FullExperience/configure-the-user-interface.md).  
  
 Users personalize the user interface of their personal version by customizing the user interface under their own user logon. For more information, see [Configure the User Interface](../FullExperience/configure-the-user-interface.md).
