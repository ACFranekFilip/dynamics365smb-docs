# How to: Create Profiles
You use profiles to link Role Centers to users. If you create a new profile, then the users that you add to this profile must have roles \(that is, database permissions\) that are consistent with the corresponding Role Center.  
  
### To create a profile  
  
1.  Choose **Departments**, choose **Administration**, and then choose **RoleTailored Client**.  
  
2.  Choose **Profiles**.  
  
3.  In the ribbon, choose **New** to open the New Profile Card window.  
  
4.  In the **Profile ID** field, enter a name that describes the role of the users you will assign to this profile.  
  
5.  In the **Description field**, enter a description of the Profile ID, such as **Order Processor**.  
  
6.  In the **Role Center ID** field, select a Role Center.  
  
7.  If you want to make this Role Center the default Profile, select the **Default Role Center** check box.  
  
8.  Choose **OK**.
