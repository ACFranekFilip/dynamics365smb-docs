# Customize the User Interface
The concept of UI customization in ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[dyn_nav](../../includes/dyn_nav_md.md)]--> is divided in two:  
  
-   Configuration, performed by the administrator  
  
-   Personalization, performed by users  
  
 The administrator configures the user interface for multiple users by customizing the user interface for a profile that the users are assigned to.  
  
 Users personalize the user interface of their personal version of the profile by customizing the user interface under their own user logon.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Only the ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[nav_windows](../../includes/nav_windows_md.md)]--> as configuration are reflected in the web client.  
  
 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them. These tasks are listed in the order in which they are generally performed.
