# How to: Copy Data from Test Environment to Production Environment
After you have vetted and tested all your setup information, you can proceed with copying data to your production environment. You create a new company in the same database.  
  
### To copy data to a production environment  
  
1.  Open and initialize the new company.  
  
2.  In the **Search** box, enter **Configuration Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
  
3.  On the **Actions** tab, in the **Tools** group, choose **Copy Data from the Company**.  
  
4.  In the **Copy Company Data** window, choose the **Copy From** field. The **Companies** window opens.  
  
5.  Select the company from which you want to copy data. Choose the **OK** button.  
  
     A list of tables selected on the configuration worksheet opens. Only tables that contain records are included in this list.  
  
6.  Select the tables that you want to copy data from and choose **Copy Data**. In the **Copy Company Data** window, choose the **OK** button.
