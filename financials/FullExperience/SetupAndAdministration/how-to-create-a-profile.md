# How to: Create a Profile
You use the **Profile** card to create profiles for end users. Each profile is associated with a Role Center. Profiles are typically based on job titles in a company.  
  
## Creating a Profile  
  
#### To create a profile  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Profiles**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the ribbon, click **New** to open the **New Profile Card** window.  
  
3.  In the **Profile ID** field, enter a name that describes the intended role of the user.  
  
4.  In the **Description** field, enter a description of the Profile ID, for example, **Order Processor**.  
  
5.  In the **Role Center ID** field, click the **AssistEdit** button to view all available Role Centers. Select a Role Center.  
  
6.  To make this Role Center the default for the profile, select **Default Role Center**.  
  
7.  Click **OK** to save your changes.  
  
 The procedure for modifying an existing profile is the same, except you select an existing profile in the Profiles page instead of clicking **New**.
