# How to: View Change Log Entries
After you have set up the change log, activated it, and made a change to data, ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[navnow](../../includes/navnow_md.md)]--> logs the change in a change log entry. You can view and filter the changes in the **Change Log Activated** window.  
  
### To view change log entries  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Change Log Entries**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **Change Log Entries** window, remove any filters. The window now displays all change log entries.  
  
     ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[bp_fieldhelp]()]-->
