# How to: Use the RapidStart Services Role Center to Track Progress
When you use FIX INCLUDE HERE<!--[!INCLUDE[rim](../Roles/includes/rim_md.md)] -->, we recommend that you track your work and use the RapidStart Services Role Center as your home page. It provides the correct context for your configuration work. To change your Role Center home page, see [How to: Change Role Centers](../GettingStarted/how-to-change-role-centers.md). Choose the RapidStart Profile ID.  
  
 As you continue with your work, you can assign each table the status that reflects where you are in the process. FIX INCLUDE HERE<!--FIX INCLUDE HERE<!--[!INCLUDE[navnow](../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)] --> --> then keeps track of the table status in the **Activities** part on the **Home** page.  
  
 By default, when you add a table to the configuration worksheet, its status is set to blank. This means that configuration of the table has not begun. This is reflected in the **Not Started** count in the **Activities** tile.  
  
 For more information about table status options, see Status.  
  
### To update the status of a configuration table  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Configuration Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  On the **Home** tab, in the **Manage** group, choose **Edit List**.  
  
3.  Select a table, and in the **Status** field, choose the appropriate status.  
  
     FIX INCLUDE HERE<!--[!INCLUDE[bp_fieldhelp]()] -->  
  
4.  Choose the **OK** button.  
  
 When you return to the role center **Home** page, the tiles in the **Activities** part are updated to reflect your changes.  
  
### To track the status of a configuration project  
  
-   Open the RapidStart Services role center **Home** page.  
  
     In the **Configuration Areas** part, [!INCLUDE[navnow](../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)] tracks the completion statistics for the areas and groups that you have set up in your configuration. If you have not set up any groups or areas, this part has no data.  
  
### To see a filtered view of table status  
  
1.  Open the RapidStart Services role center **Home** page.  
  
2.  In the navigation pane, expand **Tables**.  
  
3.  To see a list of tables with a particular status, select the appropriate filtered view.
