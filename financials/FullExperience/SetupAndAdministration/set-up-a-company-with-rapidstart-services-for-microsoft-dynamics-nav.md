# Set Up a Company With RapidStart Services for Microsoft Dynamics NAV
You can set up a new company in ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[navnow](../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)]--> with ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[rimlong](../SetupAndAdministration/includes/rimlong_md.md)]-->. ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[rim](../Roles/includes/rim_md.md)]--> is a tool designed to shorten deployment times, improve quality of implementation, introduce a repeatable approach to implementations, and enhance productivity by automating and simplifying recurring tasks.  
  
 ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[rim](../Roles/includes/rim_md.md)]--> helps you gain an overview of the setup process of your new company by providing a worksheet in which you can set up the tables often involved in the configuration process of new companies. As you do this, you can create a questionnaire to guide your customers through the collection of setup information. Your customers have the option of using the questionnaire to set up application areas, or they can open the setup page directly and do the setup there. Most importantly, ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[rim](../Roles/includes/rim_md.md)]--> helps you, as a customer, prepare the company with default setup data that you can fine-tune and customize. Lastly, when you use ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[rim](../Roles/includes/rim_md.md)]-->, you can configure and migrate existing customer data, such as a list of customers or items, into the new company.  
  
 You can use the following components to speed the setup of a new company:  
  
-   Configuration wizard  
  
-   Configuration worksheet  
  
-   Configuration packages  
  
-   Configuration templates  
  
-   Configuration questionnaire  
  
 You can find the tools in the ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[rtc](../BusinessFunctionality/IntegratingWithMicrosoftDynamicsCRM/includes/rtc_md.md)]--> in the **Application Setup** area.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  There are areas of ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[navnow](../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)]--> that you will have to set up manually. These include adding users, setting up accounting periods, and setting up dimensions for business intelligence.  
  
 The following table describes the sequence of tasks with links to topics that describe them. These tasks are listed in the order in which you generally perform them.
