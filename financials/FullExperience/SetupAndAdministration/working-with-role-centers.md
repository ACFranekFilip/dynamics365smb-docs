# Working with Role Centers
A Role Center is a home page in FIX INCLUDE HERE<!--[!INCLUDE[navnow](../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)] --> for all users of a profile. For example, the Order Processor Role Center has been configured to reflect the tasks and priorities of an order processor. In FIX INCLUDE HERE<!--[!INCLUDE[rtc](../BusinessFunctionality/IntegratingWithMicrosoftDynamicsCRM/includes/rtc_md.md)] -->s, the profile that is used appears in the header of the Role Centerâ€™s main content area. An administrator can then customize this Role Center to meet the needs of a specific role in a specific company. The Order Processor Role Center can then be further personalized on a single computer to meet the needs of a person who is carrying out the job as an order processor. This person can personalize the Role Center by saving queries, adding filters, and adding or removing fields.
