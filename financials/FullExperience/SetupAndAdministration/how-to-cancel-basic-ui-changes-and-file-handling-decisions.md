# How to: Cancel Basic UI Changes and File Handling Decisions
You cancel you basic UI changes and decisions for handling of files and automation objects by opening the **Reset User\-Specified Settings** window from your Role Center.  
  
 As basic types of UI personalization, you can change the size and position of any window, the width of columns, and the height of column headers, and you can change the sorting of data in columns. For more information, see [How to: Make Basic UI Changes](../SetupAndAdministration/how-to-make-basic-ui-changes.md).  
  
 You also perform a basic type of personalization when you select whether to run, save, or cancel external files by default and whether to allow automation objects by default. For more information, see [How to: Specify How to Handle External Files and Automation Objects](../SetupAndAdministration/how-to-specify-how-to-handle-external-files-and-automation-objects.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  You perform your main UI personalization in the **Customize** window. The **Reset User\-Specified Settings** function does not cancel changes that you make in the **Customize** window. For more information, see [How to: Cancel UI Personalization](../SetupAndAdministration/how-to-cancel-ui-personalization.md).  
  
### To cancel basic UI changes that you have made to window sizes, column sizes, or column sorting

     On the **Application** menu ![Application Menu button in menu bar](../BusinessFunctionality/IntegratingWithMicrosoftOffice/media/applicationmenuicon.png "ApplicationMenuIcon"), choose **Customize**, and then choose **Reset User\-Specified Settings**.  
  
2.  Choose the **Reset UI settings** button. Alternatively, choose the **Reset all** button to also cancel your decisions for handling files and automation objects.  
  
 All basic UI changes that you have ever made under your current user logon to [!INCLUDE[dyn_nav](../ApplicationDesign/includes/dyn_nav_md.md)], or since you last chose the **Reset UI settings** button, are canceled. The user interface is reset to the default configuration for your profile.
