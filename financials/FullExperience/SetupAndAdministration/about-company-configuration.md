# About Company Configuration
You can provide a customer or prospective customer with an installation of ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[navnow](../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)]--> and a selection of configuration packages that can be easily accessed, deployed, modified, and applied to the current company.  
  
## File\-Based  
 In the file based configuration of ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[navnow](../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)]-->, you install the configuration files at a file location that can be easily accessed, such as on the product media, or on a file server, SharePoint server, or FTP server.
