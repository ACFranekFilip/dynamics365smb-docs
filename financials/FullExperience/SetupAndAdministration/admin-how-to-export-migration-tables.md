# How to: Export Migration Tables
After you have determined the tables for which you want to transfer customer data, you export the files.  
  
### To export data migration files  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Configuration Packages**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select and open the package that you want to use for export. Select the table or tables that you want to export.  
  
3.  You can export the tables into Excel.  
  
     On the **Tables** toolbar, on the **Excel** menu, choose **Export to Excel** and save the Excel workbook.  
  
4.  Save the exported file.  
  
5.  Repeat this procedure for all the relevant data migration tables. If you select multiple tables at the same time, the export of their data is into a common workbook.  
  
 If the table is empty, the resulting data migration file contains empty cells for the fields you selected when you chose or created migration tables for your new company. If the selected data migration table contains data, it will be exported.
