# Transfer and Post Cost Entries
Before you define cost allocations, you must understand how cost entries come from the following sources:  

-   Automatic transfer of general ledger entries.  

-   Manual cost posting for pure cost entries, internal charges, and manual allocations.  

-   Automatic allocation postings for actual costs.  

-   Transfer of budget entries to actual.
