If you have the Basic experience, then you must manually initiate the counting of your inventory. For more information, see [How to: Count, Adjust, and Reclassify Inventory](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md).

# How to: Perform Cycle Counting
Although you count all items in inventory at least once a year, you may have decided to count some items more often, perhaps because they are more valuable, or because they are very fast movers and a large part of your business.

Before you begin cycle counting, you must set up and assign physical inventory counting periods.

You can perform the cycle counting in either of the following ways depending on your warehouse setup:

- If your location is not using directed put-away and pick, you use the **Phys. Inventory Journal** window, and the procedure is much the same as when you conduct a physical inventory without cycle counting.
- If your location is using directed put-away and pick, you first use the **Whse. Phys. Invt. Journal** window, and then you use the Item Journal window to run the Calculate Whse. Adjustment function.
