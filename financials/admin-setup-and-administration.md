# Administration
Central administration tasks are usually performed by one role in the company. The scope of these tasks can depend on the company's size and the administrator's job responsibilities. These tasks can include managing database synchronization of job and email queues, setting up users, customizing the user interface, and managing encryption keys.  

Entering the correct setup values from the start is important to the success of any new business software. [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] includes a number of setup guides that help you set up core data. For more information, see [Setting Up Finance and Operations, Business edition](setup.md).

<!--Whether you use [!INCLUDE[rim](../../includes/rim_md.md)] to implement setup values or you manually enter them in the new company, you can support your setup decisions with some general recommendations for selected setup fields that are known to potentially cause the solution to be inefficient if defined incorrectly.-->  

A super user or an administrator can set up the Data Exchange Framework to enable users to export and import data in bank and payroll files, for example for various cash management processes.  

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.
