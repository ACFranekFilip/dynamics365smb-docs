# How to: Collect Outstanding Balances
Managing receivables includes checking whether amounts due are paid on time. If customers have overdue payments, you can send the Customer Statement report as a reminder.

**Note**: If you are using multiple currencies, the Customer Statement report is always printed in the customer's currency. The last date in a statement period is also used as the statement date and the aging date, if aging is included.

1. In the top right corner, choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon, enter **Customer Statement**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. Choose a field to read a short description of the field or link to more information.
3. Under **Output Options**, select how to send the report to the customer.
