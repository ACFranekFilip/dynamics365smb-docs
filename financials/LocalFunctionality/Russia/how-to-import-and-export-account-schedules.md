1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Account Schedule Names** or **Account Schedules**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **Account Schedule Names**or **Account Schedules** window, on the **Home** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Import Settings** or **Export Settings**. An extensible markup language (XML) file will be created for the import or export.
