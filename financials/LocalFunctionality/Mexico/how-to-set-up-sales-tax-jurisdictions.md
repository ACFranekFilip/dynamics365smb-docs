# How to: Set Up Sales Tax Jurisdictions
In the United States, states, counties, cities, and localities can charge sales tax.  
  
 In Canada, the federal government and provinces can charge sales tax. Companies collect and remit sales tax to these government authorities for products sold to end users.  
  
 Sales tax can also be charged to existing sales tax. For example, tax can be calculated on a sales invoice amount that already ../../includes the tax from other jurisdictions.  
  
 Tax amounts must be detailed in documents for each tax jurisdiction in Canada. Up to four jurisdictions can be displayed in a document, and jurisdictions that have the same print order are combined when they are printed.  
  
 Each tax area is a grouping of sales tax jurisdictions based on a particular geographic location. For example, the Miami, Florida, tax area ../../includes three sales tax jurisdictions: city (Miami), county (Dade), and state (Florida).
