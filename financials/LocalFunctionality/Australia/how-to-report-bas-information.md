# How to: Report BAS Information
You need to report the Business Activity Statement (BAS) calculation information for goods and services tax (GST). The **C** and **D** fields on the **Totals** FastTab in the **BAS Calculation Sheet** window are used for fuel tax credits.  
  
### To report BAS information and calculate the GST settlement  
  
1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **BAS Calculation Sheets**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  On the **Home** tab, in the **New** group, choose **New**.  
  
3.  In the **BAS Calculation Sheet** window, on the **Home** tab, in the **Process** group, choose **Import**.  
  
4.  In the **BAS – Import/Export** window, enter the BAS file name to import a sample XML file. The totals information will be updated. Choose the **OK** button.
