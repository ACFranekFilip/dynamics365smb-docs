# How to: Set Up Standard Operations
The use of standard tasks simplifies the creation and maintenance of routings. They allow you to enter recurring routing lines in an extra table. You can use these table entries when maintaining routings.

To create a standard task
In the Search box, enter Standard Tasks, and then choose the related link.

On the Home tab, in the New group, choose New.

In the Code field, enter any combination of numbers and letters, which identify this standard task uniquely.

In the Description field, enter a description of the standard task.

Choose the OK button to exit the window.



If you require personnel with qualifications, special knowledge, or special authorization for a special task, you can assign these people to the task.  

### To assign personnel to standard tasks
