# Accountant experiences in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]
Any business must do its books and sign off on the accounting. Some businesses employ an external accountant, and others have an accountant on staff. No matter which type of accountant you are, you can use the **Accountant** role center as your Home in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. From here, you can access all windows that you need in your work.  

## Accountant role center
The role center includes activity tiles that show you real-time key figures and give you quick access to data. In the ribbon at the top of the window, you have access to more actions. In the navigation pane to the left,  you can quickly switch between the lists you use most often. If you expand the **Home** menu in the navigation pane, you will see other areas, such as **Posted Documents** with the various types of documents that the company has posted.  

**Note**: This functionality requires that your experience is set to **Suite**. For more information, see [Customizing Your [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] Experience](ui-experiences.md).  

## Accountant Portal
If you are an accountant with several clients, you can use the accountant portal as your dashboard for a better overview of your clients. From there, you can access each client's tenant in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] and use the Accountant role center as described above.  

The accountant portal is a dedicated version of [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. You can get access to the portal by signing up from [Financials for Accountants on Microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/financial-insights-for-accountants), or by adding the [Accountant Portal extension](ui-extensions-accountant-portal.md) to your [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)].
