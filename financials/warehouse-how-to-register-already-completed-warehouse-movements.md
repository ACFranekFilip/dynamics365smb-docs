# How to: Register Already Completed Warehouse Movements
If your location uses directed put-away and pick, and you need to move items to other bins without a pre-existing warehouse put-away, pick, or movement, you can register the correct placement of the items in the warehouse using the **Whse. Reclassification Journal**.  

## To register the movement of an item that has already occurred  
1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Whse. Reclassification Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Fill in the **Item No.**, **From Zone Code**, **From Bin Code**, **To Zone Code**, and **To Bin Code** fields.  
3.  Choose the **Register** action.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  In this journal, you cannot create a warehouse movement instruction.
