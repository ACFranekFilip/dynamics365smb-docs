# Customizing Your [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] Experience
[!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] is designed to help you run your business, regardless which line of business you are in. At the core of [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], you find financial reporting and sales and purchasing processes. You add experiences to that according to your business needs by adding [extensions from AppSource](ui-extensions.md). But you can also turn up and down the volume on the user experience and choose what's right for your company.

## Choosing a user experience
The user experience determines how much of the core functionality is available when you and your colleagues use [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. You can choose the user experience for your company in the **Company Information** window, in the **Experience** field.
  
**Note**: This setting applies to all users in your company.

The following table lists the experiences that are currently available.

| Experience | Impact on User Interface |
| --- | --- |
| Basic |Shows only core actions and fields for core business areas, such as sales, purchasing, finance, and opportunity management. |
| Suite |Shows more actions and fields for core business areas and for other areas, such as project management, fixed asset management, and analysis by dimensions. |
