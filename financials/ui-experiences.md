# Customizing Your [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] Experience
[!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] is designed to help you run your business, regardless which line of business you are in. At the core of [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], you find financial reporting and sales and purchasing processes. You add experiences to that according to your business needs by adding extensions from AppSource. You can also turn up and down the volume on the user experience and choose what's right for your company. For more information, see [Customizing [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] Using Extensions](ui-extensions.md).

> [!NOTE]  
>   This setting applies to all users in your company. Users can customize thier own experience even further by changing page layouts and content. For more information, see [Personalizing Your Workspace and Pages](ui-personalization-user.md).

## Choosing a user experience
The user experience determines how much of the core functionality is available when you and your colleagues use [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. You can choose the user experience for your company in the **Company Information** window, in the **Experience** field.

The following table lists the experiences that are currently available.

| Experience | Impact on User Interface |
| --- | --- |
| **Basic** |Shows only core actions and fields within the most common business functionality, such as sales, purchasing, inventory, and finance. |
| **Essential** |Shows all actions and fields for all common business functionality.|

> [!NOTE]  
> With the Sandbox option, you can select the **Advanced** experience, which gives access to all possible business functionality, including Manufacturing and Service Management. For more information, see [How to: Create a Sandbox Environment](across-how-create-sandbox-environment.md).
