# Document focus Mode

When working on a document that includes an line items section, like a sales order or invoice page, you can switch to the *focus mode* to give you more room to work with and concentrate on the line items. The focus mode expands the line item section so that it occupies pretty much the entire workspace, hiding other parts of the page except the actions area at the top. The focus mode is particularly beneficial when working with large line item lists and fast data entry is desired.

Another advantage of the the focus mode is that advanced filtering is available, so browsing and searching through line items becomes even easier.

## Switching the focus mode on and off

To switch to the focus mode, select anywhere in the line item section, and then choose ![Focus Mode icon](media/focus-mode.png "Focus mode icon") in the upper right corner or press Ctrl+Shift+F12.

To switch off the focus mode, choose ![Focus Mode icon](media/focus-mode.png "Focus mode icon") or press Ctrl+Shift+F12 again.

## Using filtering in the focus mode

When in focus mode on a document, you can now enable the advanced filter experience just as on any other list. This helps especially when viewing and analysing longer documents. Imagine you can open a posted sales invoice and filter the line items to all that have the individual discount above 5%. Or filter to only bike accessories with 'pro' in the name.
