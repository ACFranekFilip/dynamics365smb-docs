# Need More Time to Decide Whether to Subscribe?
It's important to make the right decision when choosing a business application, and it can take time to explore all of the corners in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. If you are the business manager or owner, it probably isn't the only thing you have on your plate. 

If your 30 day trial period is running out, you can extend it yourself for another 30 days. Note that extending the trial period is a one time thing. You cannot extend twice, at least not yourself. You can, however, contact a partner . 

## What happens when the trial period expires?
When your first 30 trial period expires you can extend it yourself and things will be business as usual. When your extended trial period expires, you'll have to contact one of our partners.

## To extend your trial period
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Extend Trial**, and then select the related link.
