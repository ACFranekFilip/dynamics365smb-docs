# Add comments to cards and documents
You can add extra information to accounts, customers cards, or sales orders to communicate agreements, such as a special price or delivery method, to other users.
Practically all cards, documents, and journals have a **Comments** action, which opens a small window where you can write or read comments. 

Comments are not printed or output to externally-facing documents, and comments on ongoing documents are not transferred to posted documents.  

## To add a comments to an item card
1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant item card.
3. Choose the **Comments** action.
4. In the **Comment Sheet** window, enter any text, and then choose the **OK** button.
