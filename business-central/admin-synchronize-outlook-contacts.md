# Synchronize Contacts in Business Central with Contacts in Microsoft Outlook
You can see the same contacts in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] as you see in Outlook if you set up contact synchronization.  

A designated folder in Outlook makes the information easy to find, and a filter allows each user to synchronize only the contacts from [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] that they want to see in Outlook. Once the contact synchronization is set up, each user can enable the automatic synchronization that will keep the contacts in sync on a scheduled basis.  

## Synchronize Contacts
In [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], your administrator must set up Exchange synchronization and apply your email address to your entry in the **Users** list. Then you can define which contacts to synchronize between [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] and Outlook. For example, you can set a filter on name, type, company, or similar.  

Once this synchronization has been set up, any changes to that you make to the contact in either Outlook or in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] is automatically synchronized to the other.
