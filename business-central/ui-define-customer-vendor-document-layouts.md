# Define Special Document Layouts for Customers and Vendors
When custom report layouts are defined, you can select them from customer and vendor cards to specify that the selected layouts will be used for documents that you crate for the customer or vendor in question. The value in the **Usage** field, defines which process the document layout will be used for, such as **Reminder**, **Shipment**, and **Order Confirmation**.

In addition to setting up which layouts to use for what document, you can save time when sending documents to different customer or vendor contacts by setting up specific contacts' email addresses to use with specific documents. For example, customer statements will be sent to accountant contacts, sales orders to your customers' purchasers, and purchase orders to vendors' salespeople or account managers.
