The general journal only shows a limited number of fields on the journal line by default. If you want to see additional fields, such as the **Account Type** field, choose the **Show More Columns** action. To hide the additional fields again, choose the **Show Fewer Columns** action.  When displaying the limited number of fields, the same posting date is used for all lines. If you wish to have multiple posting dates for the same journal entry, choose the Show More Columns action.
