# Enabling upcoming features ahead of time

Some new features can be enabled ahead of time on your environment, allowing you to benefit as early as possible, and giving you the time you need to test and prepare your organization for change.

When Microsoft releases features or feature design improvements as part of minor updates, some of these are not immediately enabled. Administrators can enable each feature from the **Feature Management** page. When a feature is enabled, it becomes available for all users on that environment no matter how they access [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)]. Features can be safely turned off again. These features are only optional for a period of time.
