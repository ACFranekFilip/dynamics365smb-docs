# Using Search to Find Things  
This topic describes various ways to look for things in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)].

## Find Pages, Reports, Actions, and Documentation 
When you need help finding a page, report, an article in our documentation, or an action on the page that is open, use the ![Tell me what you want to do](media/ui-search/search.png "Search for Page or Report") icon to search for it by name.

When you start typing characters, [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] immediately displays matches in a drop-down list. Results in the list change as you type more characters. The second column in the drop-down list indicates where to find the pages. 

### Find an Action on the Current Page
The **On current page** section lists the actions on the page you have open that are related to your search. For example, if the Sales Quote page is open and you enter "customer," the section will include an action that opens the customer card for the customer chosen on the sales quote. 

> [!NOTE]  
> The list includes only actions that are available in the Navigation Bar at the top of the page. Actions on FasTabs are not included.  

### Find a Page or a Task
The **Go to Pages and Tasks** section lists other pages that might be useful for your search topic.   

> [!NOTE]  
>   The available pages and reports depend on the user experience you choose for your company. The **Essential** experience gives access to fewer than the **Premium** experience does. The first time you sign in, you use the Essential experience. For more information, see [Customizing Your [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] Experience](ui-experiences.md).

### Find a Report or a Chart
The **Go to Reports and Analysis** section offers access to details about the subject of your search.  

### Find Information in the Help
Under **Documentation** you will see articles from the [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] documentation that describe concepts and provide step-by-step guidance for completing tasks related to your search.  

## Searching for Data
<!--Need to verify this section-->
The **Tell me what you want to do** function does not search for data, such as customer names, addresses, or transactions. Instead, you can search for data in list pages by choosing the magnifier symbol in the right corner of the list header. The search applies only to the list you are viewing. For more information, see [Entering Criteria in Filters](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md).
