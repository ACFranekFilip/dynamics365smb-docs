# Set up your business information in [!INCLUDE[d365inv_long](includes/d365inv_long.md)]

For the invoices to include your business address and other important information, you can define this in the **Setting** page. Here, you can upload your logo, specify your tax details, add links to your social network accounts, and make other general customizations.  

## To add your business information

1. In [!INCLUDE[d365inv](includes/d365inv.md)], in the top right corner, choose the gear symbol, and then choose **My Settings**.  
2. In the Settings panel, in the **Business information** section, upload your logo, add your company name, specify your address, and add other information that you want to capture here.  
3. In the **Email account** section, specify the email account that is used to send emails to your customers. This can be your business email or any other other email that you use to represent your business.  
4. In the **Invoice and estimate numbers** section, verify that the numbers have the format that you want. To change the format, choose the button next to the number that you want to change.  
5. When you are ready, choose the OK button.
