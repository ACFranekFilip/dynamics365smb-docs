# Resources for Help and Support

In [!INCLUDE[prodlong](includes/prodlong.md)], the Help menu item (the question mark in the top right corner) gives you access to the **Help & Support** page, where you can find links to resources that can help you find answers to your question. You can also see how you can contact technical support for your [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)].  

This page outlines the resources available to you in the different sections of the **Help and Support** page.  

## Find it

The **Find it** section provides links to the most common places to find answers to your questions.

### Product Help

The **Find it** section includes two links to product Help:

- Help about the page you were just viewing in [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)]  
- Help landing page for the default version of [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)]  

The link for to learn more about the page that you were viewing when you opened the **Help and Support** page is automatically generated. If [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] cannot find the relevant link, the landing page for [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] on [Docs.microsoft.com](index.md) is shown. For example, this can happen if the page was part of an app that did not add context-sensitive Help mapping to [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)].  

The functionality in the default version of [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] is described on the [Docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/business-central) site. In addition to the default version, you can extend and customize [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] with apps from AppSource. All apps provide tooltips and links to the relevant product Help.  

### Community

In the [Business Central Forum](https://community.dynamics.com/business/f), you can submit a question and learn from other [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] community members. Partners and Microsoft employees participate in the conversations.  

### Blog

The [Business Central blog](https://community.dynamics.com/business/b/financials) is where you can learn more about new [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] capabilities, new app releases, tips and tricks, as well as updates about new country releases.  

### Roadmap

The [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] [roadmap page](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/roadmap/business-central/) shows the general direction in the coming years. [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] is updated with major feature updates every 6 months and monthly service updates, and you can get an overview of upcoming and recently released capabilities in the release notes at [https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/business-applications/release/#release-notes](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/business-applications/release/#release-notes).  

## Feedback

On the [Dynamics 365 Ideas site](https://aka.ms/bcideas), you can provide suggestions for new feature and capabilities. Your input goes directly to Business Centralâ€™s engineering backlog for investigation and prioritization.  

Make sure to search through the list of submitted suggestions, as chances are that someone already submitted something similar and might have already received votes. Vote if an idea already has been submitted to get it prioritized on the engineering backlog.  

## Troubleshooting

The **Troubleshooting** section shows technical information that your administrator or [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] partner can use to unblock users. This includes information about the latest error message, the current version of [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)], and a link to go to the **Page Inspection** page. For more information, see [Inspecting Pages in Business Central](across-inspect-pages.md)

## Report a problem

Your [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] reselling partner is expected to help you with technical support. [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] is sold through partners, and the email address in this section enables you to contact your reselling partner. If your [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)]  partner then cannot resolve the problem, they will raise a support ticket with Microsoft.  

If you have signed up for a trial and have not yet purchased [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)], you do not have a reselling partner, and you cannot contact the Microsoft support team.  

You can find a [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] partner on the [I'm looking for a solution provider](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2038145) page.  

### Support email address

The email address that is shown in the **Report a problem** section can be for a person or a team. If you are the [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] reselling partner for a tenant, you can set up this email address in the **Support Contact Info Card** page. <!--TODO: More info on which link to click-->
