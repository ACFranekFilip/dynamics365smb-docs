# Finding Pages and Navigating from a Feature Overview
You can get an overview of all the business features that are available for your role, and for other roles if you go a step further. Each element on the overview is an action that opens a page. Accordingly, you can also use the feature overview as a means to navigate in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)].

You can open the feature overview from the Role Center and from the **Tell Me** window.

- On your Role Center, choose the ![Menu button](media/ui_menu_button.png "Menu button") button to the right of the navigation bar.
- In the **Tell Me** window, choose the **exploring** action at the bottom of the box.

To get an overview of business feature that are available for all other roles, in addition to your own, choose the **Explore all** action.

> [!NOTE]
> Only roles where the **Show in Role Explorer** check box is selected for the related profile will appear on the feature overview for all roles. For more information, see [Manage Profiles](admin-users-profiles-roles.md).
