# Finding Pages with the Role Explorer
You can get an overview of all the business features that are available for your role, and for other roles if you go a step further. Each element on the role explorer is an action that opens a page. Accordingly, you can also use the role explorer as a means to navigate in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)].

You can open the role explorer from the Role Center and all list pages and from the **Tell Me** window.

- On your Role Center or any list page, choose the ![Menu button](media/ui_menu_button.png "Menu button") button to the right of the navigation bar.
- In the **Tell Me** window, choose the **exploring** action at the bottom.

To get an overview of business feature that are available for all other roles, in addition to your own, choose the **Explore all** action on the page that presents the role explorer.

> [!NOTE]
> Only roles where the **Show in Role Explorer** check box is selected for the related profile will appear on the feature overview for all roles. For more information, see [Manage Profiles](admin-users-profiles-roles.md).

## To expand/collapse nodes on the role explorer
The actions that open pages are organized under nodes named after the features or application areas. Each node can be collapsed or expanded individually and you can collapse/expand all nodes together.

Some nodes contain sub nodes. To expand/collapse all nodes in one go, you can use the Ctrl+Shift+choose combination.

- To expand/collapse a node, choose the node. This applies to top-level nodes and sub nodes.
- To expand/collapse all top-level nodes on the page, choose the **Expand** or **Collapse** action in the top-right corner.
- To expand/collapse a top-level node and all sub nodes under it, press the Ctrl+Shift keys while you choose the **Expand** or **Collapse** action in the top-right corner.
