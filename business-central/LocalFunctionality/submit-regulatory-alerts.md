# Submit alerts about country/region-specific regulatory features

We invite you to use Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) to submit regulatory alerts through the Dynamics regulatory alert submission service.  

## To submit a regulatory alert in LCS

1. Go to https://lcs.dynamics.com and log in<br>
    You will be presented with the projects you have access to.

2. Select the **Regulatory Alerts - Worldwide** project<br>
    This will open the project and show a variety of things related to this project.

3. Select the **Alert service** on the right side in the **More tools** section<br>
    You will see a list of alerts with the headline **Dynamics Regulatory Alert Submission**

4. You can add a new alert by clicking the plus sign **(+)** sign at the top of the list<br>
    This will present you with a 4-step guide to create the alert.<br>
    The guide has these steps:<br>
    * Search for existing items
        * Search for any information you think is relevant for the alert you are going to create. If you do not find any relevant search results you can select the **Submit regulatory alert** button at the bottom of the page to proceed with the alert submission.
    * Attach business processes
        * This part is not relevant for Dynamics 365 Business Central. Choose **Skip** to proceed to the next step.
    * Describe the alert
        * Enter information about the alert in the appropriate fields. Required fields are indicated by a red asterisk (<strong>\*</strong>).
