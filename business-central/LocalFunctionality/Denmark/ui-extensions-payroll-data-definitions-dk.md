# The Payroll Data Definitions (DK) Extension
Install payroll services data exchange definitions for Danish service providers: Danloen, Dataloen, Loenservice, Multiloen, and Proloen. Exchange definitions let you exchange data in specific tables with data on external files, for example, so that you can send and receive electronic documents, import and export bank data or other data, such as payroll currency exchange rates, and item catalogues.

## Getting Started with the Extension
After you install the extension, configure it for the payroll service you use. To do that, go to the **General Ledger Setup** page where you will find a section for importing payroll. After you specify the service, you can use the **Import Payroll File** button on the **General Journals** page to import the data definitions.
