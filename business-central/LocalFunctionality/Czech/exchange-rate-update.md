# Exchange Rate Updating

The Company is allowed to automatically update currency exchange rates using Exchange Rate Services.  
These have been improved by the ability to automatically update currency exchange rates from the CNB (Czech National Bank).  
The user can define the http service address and other exchange rate update parameters in the exchange rate service settings.
