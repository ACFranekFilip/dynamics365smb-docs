# Sales VAT Advance Notifications  
A Sales VAT Advance Notification in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)] is an XML document that contains tax and base amounts, along with company information. The XML document is set up using the layout that is defined in the tax authorities' style sheet.  <!-- Do they need to get the stylesheet from the tax authorities, or is that something we've done for them? -->

## Set Up and Export Sales VAT Advance Notifications
[!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)] can create files used to report VAT to the German authorities. These files will be created as XML files in the format specified by the German tax authorities and can be saved to your computer when created. From here you must submit them to the authorities on the Elektronische Steuererkl√§rungen (ELSTER) online portal.

To create valid sales VAT advance notifications, you must set up the following:  

- The company registration information and tax office information.  
- Basic sales VAT advance notification in the **Electronic VAT Decl. Setup**. <!--Does "Decl." stand for "declaration?"-->
- The VAT statement.

|**Sales VAT Adv. Notif. Path**|Enter the path and name of the folder where you want to store the XML files. <!--Do they provide the name of the folder, or are they just specifying the full path?-->|
|**XML File Default Name**|Enter the name of the file what you want to store the XML files. <!-- Don't understand this sentence. Should it just be "enter the name of the file?"-->|

Ask your tax office if you have questions concerning the key figures and their definition.
