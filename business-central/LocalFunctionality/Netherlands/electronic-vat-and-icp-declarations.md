# Electronic VAT and ICP Declarations
Companies must submit periodic VAT and ICP declarations.  

VAT declarations must be submitted on a monthly or quarterly basis.  

Companies that sell goods or services to European Union (EU) countries must submit Intracommunautaire leveringen (ICP) declarations on a quarterly basis. Purchases are not included in this declaration. For these intracommunautaire transactions, it is required that the merchandise have crossed the border physically. It is not enough that the location of an invoice address or the office of the vendor or customer is in another EU country or region.  

## Submitting Electronic Tax Declarations  
You can submit the VAT declarations and ICP declarations in the following ways:  

- Log on to the website of the Dutch tax office and enter the information manually. For more information, see the [website](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=223151) of the Dutch tax office.  

    For ICP declarations, you can enter a maximum of 99 lines.  

- Create an electronic declaration and submit the encrypted file through file through the Digipoort channel to the Dutch tax office..  

The electronic VAT declaration contains the posted VAT and the calculated duty liable to the customs authorities for a specified period. The data of the VAT declaration is based on the definition of the VAT statement in the **VAT Statement Line** table. For more information, see VAT Statement Line.  

The data of the ICP declaration is based on the **VAT Entry** table. For more information, see VAT Entry.
