# Company and Business Unit Relationships
In [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], a company is a legal and business entity that offers ways to secure and visualize business data. Users always work in the context of a company. The closest that [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)] comes to this concept is the business unit entity, which does not have legal or business implications.

Because business units lack legal and business implications, you cannot force a one-to-one (1:1) mapping to synchronize data between a company and a business unit, either one-way or bi-directional. To enable synchronization, we create an entity in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)] that is named BCI_Company. This entity is equivalent to the Company entity in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. To help ensure that records are synchronized in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)] we recommend the following setup for data in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)]:

* For each [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] company record that is enabled for synchronization, an associated BCI_Company record is created.
* When a BCI_Company record is created and synchronization is enabled, a default business unit is created that has the same name. Although a default team is automatically created for that business unit, the business unit is not used. <!--Is the company used instead?-->
* A separate owner team is created with the same name <!--as the business unit and company?--> and associated with the business unit.<!--to do what?-->
* By default, the owner of any record that is created and synchronized <!--I have replaced instances of "dual-write" (and derivations) with "synchronized." Hope that was correct...--> to [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)] is set to the "DW Owner" team that is linked to the associated business unit.
* The following image shows an example of this data setup in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

In this configuration, records that are related to the USMF company will be owned by a team that is linked to the USMF business unit in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. Users who can access that business unit through a security role that is set to business unitâ€“level visibility <!--where is this set? on the BU or the security role?--> can now see those records. The following example shows how to use teams to provide access to those records.

* The "Sales Manager" role is assigned to members of the "USMF Sales" team.
* Users who have the "Sales Manager" role can access any account records that are members of the same business unit that they are members of <!--should this be "as the users."-->.
* The "USMF Sales" team is linked to the USMF business unit that was mentioned earlier. Members of the "USMF Sales" team can see any account that is owned by the "USMF DW" user, which would have come from the USMF company entity in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)].

However, the 1:1 mapping between business unit, company, and team is just a starting point, as shown in the following image.

![The security role controls data visibility.](media/cds_bu_team_company_2.png)

In this example, a new "Europe" root business unit is manually created in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)] as the parent for both DEMF and ESMF. The Europe business unit is not related to synchronization. However, it can give members of the "EUR Sales" team access to account data in both DEMF and ESMF by setting the data visibility to **Parent/Child BU** on the associated security role.

Synchronization determines which team should own records. This is controlled by the **Default owning team** field on the BCI_Company record. When a BCI_Company record is enabled for synchronization we automatically create the associated business unit and owner team (if it doesn't already exist), and set the **Default owning team** field. When synchronization is enabled for an entity, administrators can change the owning team but cannot clear the field.

<!--Image placeholder for Default owning team field-->

Record values become read-only after a company is added and saved, so be sure to choose the correct company.
Only records that have company data are eligible for synchronization between the application and [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. <!--Not sure what this means-->
