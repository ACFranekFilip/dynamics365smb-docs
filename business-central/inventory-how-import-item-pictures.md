# Import Multiple Item Pictures
You can import multiple item pictures in one go. Simply name your picture files with a name corresponding to your item numbers, compress them to a zip file, and then use the **Import Item Pictures** page to manage which item pictures to import.

Practically all image file types are supported.

## To name picture files by the item names and prepare the zip file
1. At the location where your item pictures are stored, name each files according to the number of the related item.

**Example**:
|Item No.|File Name|
|-|-|
|1000|1000.bmp|
|1001|1001.bmp|
|1002|1002.bmp|

2. Collect all the files in a ZIP file. For example, in Windows Explorer, select the files, and then choose **Send to**, **Compressed (zipped) folder**.     

## To import item pictures
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Setup**, and then choose the related link.
