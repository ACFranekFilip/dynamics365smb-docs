# Creating and Managing Contacts
Different groups at your company will have business relationships with various companies. For example, a salesperson might regularly meet prospective customers and at the end of the week record the results of these visits.

All of the external entities that you have business relationships with (for example, customers, prospective customers, vendors, lawyers, and consultants) should be recorded as contacts. Having this data recorded in one central location ensures every group in your company can view and use the information efficiently. Communication with your contacts will be more successful if all details are readily available. For example, a marketing person might like to know what other products a specific customer has purchased before attempting to interest them in a new product.

In the **Type** field on the **Contact Card** page, you can set up a contact as either a person or a company, typically depending on whether you know the name of a contact person at the time of creation. Functionality is the same for both types, except for some of the additional information types that can be assigned. You can change the value of the field later, or you can use the fields on the **Inheritance** FastTab on the **Marketing Setup** page to control which data is shared between a person and the related company.

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.
