# Troubleshooting [!INCLUDE[d365inv_long](includes/d365inv_long.md)]
Read this section for tips and troubleshooting info on [!INCLUDE[d365inv](includes/d365inv.md)].

## How do I save my changes?
You might have noticed that there isn't a Save button in [!INCLUDE[d365inv](includes/d365inv.md)]. This is because everything is saved when you enter data, so that your accountant has full traceability into your transactions. Just close the window and continue working.  

## How do I close a window?
When you open an invoice, an estimate, or other windows in [!INCLUDE[d365inv](includes/d365inv.md)], there's an X in the top right corner. Choose the X to close the window. For the mobile app, it depends on your mobile device, but in many cases, you can use the Back button on your mobile device to return to the Home screen.  

## Where do I change the logo?
The logo that is printed on your invoices comes from your Office 365 business profile. For more information, see Manage your business apps in the Business center.  

## How can I change the email account that sends the invoices?
You can do that in the Settings for [!INCLUDE[d365inv](includes/d365inv.md)]. By default, invoices are sent from your Office 365 email address, but you can change that to any email account, including your personal email address.  

## Can I change the design of my invoice?
Not yet. We're working on this feature and will update our content as soon as it's available.  

## How can I delete an invoice?
If you've sent an invoice to a customer, you can cancel the invoice, but you can't delete it. When you delete an invoice, you customer gets a cancellation email and your accountant will be able to see that the invoice was cancelled. To cancel an invoice, follow these steps:
- From the Invoices list, open the invoice you want to cancel.  
- Choose Cancel.  
- Choose whether to send a cancelation email and then close the invoice.  

## Why can't I use my Dynamics 365 company in [!INCLUDE[d365inv](includes/d365inv.md)]?
If you've signed up for a trial of Dynamics 365 Business Central, but you haven't accessed your trial since April 1, 2017, then you need to log into Dynamics 365 and recreate the company before you can use it in [!INCLUDE[d365inv](includes/d365inv.md)].
