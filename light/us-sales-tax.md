# US tax rates in [!INCLUDE[d365inv_long](includes/d365inv_long.md)]
You can add tax rates on the fly when you create estimates and invoices. You can see the tax rates that you've already added in the settings for Microsoft Invoicing, and you can add new tax rates there as well.  

You can also manage the tax rates that you need in the **Settings** page. This is also where you set up your own tax information. The default tax rate is the one that you specify for your business address.  

Each tax rate is based on a particular geographic location. For example, the Miami, Florida, tax rate includes three sales tax jurisdictions: city (Miami), county (Dade), and state (Florida).  

If you set up new tax rates, you must make sure that you fill in the fields correctly. In the United States, states, counties, cities, and localities can charge sales tax. Companies collect and remit sales tax to these government authorities for products sold to end users. Sales tax can also be charged to existing sales tax. For example, tax can be calculated on a sales invoice amount that already includes the tax from other jurisdictions.  

<!--In the United States, when you sell to a customer at a location where you do not have a *situs*—or a legal location in that state—you do not collect sales tax. For locations in which you do not have a situs, ensure that both the **Tax Below Minimum** and **Tax Above Maximum** fields are 0.00.  -->
