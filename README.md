# dynamics365smb-docs
Welcome to the repository for the application help content for Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Business edition! Dynamics 365is aimed at small and midsized businesses, and this repo gives you access to the source files for the enduser Learn More content. This repo enables you to take the Dynamics 365 help and customize it to suit your application. It also provides a way for you to actively contribute to the current Dynamics NAV content.

The content is available as markdown files (.md), where each file represents an article in the help. You can edit these markdown files, and then convert them to HTML files for application.

There are different repos in GitHub for the source content and each of the languages that Microsoft translates to. The *dynamics365smb-docs* repo contains the content in English (US). If you want access to the content in other languages, navigate to the relevant repo - the names follow this pattern: *dynamics365smb-docs.<language>-<country>*, such as [nav-content.da-DK](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/dynamics365smb-docs.da-DK) for the Danish version.

**NOTE**: Microsoft accepts pull requests to the *dynamics365smb-docs* repo only, not the language-specific repos. If you have feedback about translations, you can report a GitHub issue in the relevant repo.

If you have any questions, please contact the Dynamics 365 SMB Content Experience (UA) team at nav-olh@microsoft.com.
