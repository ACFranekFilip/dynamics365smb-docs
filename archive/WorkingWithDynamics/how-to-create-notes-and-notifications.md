    title: Adding Information to Records for You and Others to See | Microsoft Docs
    description: Attach a note to any record in the application. For example, if you have extra information about a sales order that does not fit in any of the fields on the sales order, you can write a note. Then it will be available on the sales order window for you and any of your colleagues that look at the sales order.

# How to: Create Notes and Notifications
Many pages, particularly pages that display a list of records or details about a specific record, such as for customers and sales order, include **Notes** FactBox where you can write notes to a yourself or others. For example, this could be a general comment for later processing or as a question or instruction to another user, who can respond to the note using their own **Notes** FactBox. These notes or correspondences will follow the record, for example the sales order, as it is processed in the company.

<!--   
> [!NOTE]  
>  You can only select one recipient of the note.-->  
  
### To create a note  
  
1.  Open the relevant record (for example, a sales order, item or customer card).  
  
    <!-- If **Notes** is not visible on the page, then you can customize the page to display the Notes FactBox. -->
  
2.  Choose the **Notes** action, and then choose **New**. 
 
3.  Type your message in the **Note** box.  
  
     You can enter a maximum of 30 lines of text in the note.  
  
<!-- 5.  In the **To** field, enter a user ID (your own or someone elseâ€™s) to indicate who the note is for.  
  
6.  Select the **Notify** field if you want to send a notification to the user in the **To** field. 
  
     If **Notify** is selected, the note will be sent as a notification to the user's **My Notifications** on the Role Center.  -->
  
4.  Choose **OK**.
