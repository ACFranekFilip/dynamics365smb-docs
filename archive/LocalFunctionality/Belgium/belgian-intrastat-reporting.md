# Belgian Intrastat Reporting
Companies in the European Union (EU) are required to report trade with other countries in the EU. This reporting process is through Intrastat reporting or VIES (VAT Information Exchange System). There are two types of Intrastat declarations:  
  
-   Simplified declaration  
  
-   Extended declaration  
  
 To determine the type of declaration that you should use, visit the [National Bank of Belgium](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=163064) Web site.
