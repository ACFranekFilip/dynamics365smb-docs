# Swiss Electronic Payments
[!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] allows you to send invoices to customers electronically. The invoices are presented and paid directly using the customer's online banking software.  
  
## Electronic Payment Methods  
 You can make electronic payments using the following methods:  
  
-   DatenTrägerAustausch (DTA)  
  
-   Elektronischer Zahlungsauftrag (EZAG)  
  
-   Einzahlungsschein mit Referenznummer (ESR)  
  
-   Lastschrift Verfahren (LSV+)  
  
-   SEPA credit transfers  
  
### DTA and EZAG  
 The DTA electronic payment method is a universal service adopted by Swiss banks to settle payments electronically in DTA format using standardized payment records. This method is based on data carriers and data transfer. The specifications are coordinated by Swiss Interbank Clearing (SIC). For more information, see [Swiss Electronic Payments Using DTA](swiss-electronic-payments-using-dta.md).  
  
 EZAG is the electronic payment method of Swiss PostFinance, and requires a giro account. You can create and send orders for vendor payments in DTA bank format or PostFinance EZAG format.  
  
### ESR  
 ESR is an electronic debtor service that uses payment slips to collect money. It is the standard electronic payment system created by Swiss Post. You can print ESR payment slips as invoice attachments, calculate ESR reference numbers, and import ESR files that have payment information from banks. For more information, see [Swiss Electronic Payments Using ESR](how-to-print-esr-invoices.md). You can also make ESR and ESR+ payments using the bank’s version of this payment method, which is named Bank-ESR (BESR).  
  
### LSV+  
 LSV+ is a direct debit service that is used for processing payments. Companies can release customer payments directly from the customer's bank using direct debit. You can request and collect customer payments using direct debit in the LSV+ bank format, or in the DebitDirect PostFinance format. For more information, see [Swiss Electronic Payments Using LSV+](swiss-electronic-payments-using-lsv-.md).  
  
### SEPA Credit Transfers  
 To export payments according to the SEPA standard, you must use a bank account. To make sure that the related general ledger entries are consistent with those generated for local Swiss payment methods (see above), the value in the **Bank Acc. Posting Group** field in the **Bank Account Card** window must point to the relevant general ledger account. For more information about how to export SEPA payments, see [Make Payments with Bank Data Conversion Service or SEPA Credit Transfer](make-payments-with-bank-data-conversion-service-or-sepa-credit-transfer.md).
