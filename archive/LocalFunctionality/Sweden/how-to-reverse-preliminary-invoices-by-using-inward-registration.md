2.  Select an invoice that has been posted using inward registration.  
  
3.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Invoice** group, choose **Inward Registration**.  
  
4.  On the **Actions** tab, choose **Edit** to open the **Inward Registration** window.  
  
5.  On the **Actions** tab, in the **Posting** group, and then choose **Reverse**.
