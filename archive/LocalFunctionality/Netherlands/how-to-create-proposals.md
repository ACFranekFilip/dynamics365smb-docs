# How to: Create Proposals
Proposals can be generated manually or automatically based on either vendor or customer ledger entries.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  To create a proposal, you must use the **Owner Information** field in the Vendor Bank Account Card and Customer Bank Account Card windows.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  At any time and at any level, before processing a proposal, the transaction mode and bank account can be modified. At the lowest level on the relevant vendor or customer ledger entries.  
  
#### To create proposals manually  
  
1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Telebank - Bank Overview**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the relevant bank account. On the **Actions** tab, in the **Telebank** group, choose **Proposal**.  
  
3.  At a minimum, you must fill in the **Account Type**, **Account No.**, **Transaction Mode**, **Bank Account No.**, and **Amount** fields.  
  
       
  
4.  If you want to view or adjust the proposal's detail lines, in the **Lines** part, in the toolbar, choose **Detail Information**. To return to the proposal, close the **Proposal Detail Line** window.  
  
#### To create proposals automatically from sales  
  
1.  Set up a card for the customer who sent the invoice with appropriate values for the **Currency Code**, **Transaction Mode**, and **Bank Account** fields.  
  
       
  
2.  Create a sales invoice or credit memo, enter the customer and relevant items and post the invoice. Check whether the **Currency Code**, **Transaction Mode**, and **Bank Account** fields of the invoice/credit memo contain appropriate values. By default, they will be copied from the customer card.  
  
       
  
3.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Telebank - Bank Overview**, and then choose the related link.

     You can use the Get Proposal Entries Batch Job batch job to generate proposal lines based on relevant customer ledger entries.
