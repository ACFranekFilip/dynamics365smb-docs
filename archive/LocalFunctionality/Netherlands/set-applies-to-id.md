# Set Applies-to ID
Use this to apply one or more G/L entries. Select the entry, and then choose **Set Applies-to ID**.  
  
 If you are applying from the G/L entry list, the program will mark the entries that will be included by inserting three asterisks (***) or (if you work in a multi-user system) your user ID next to the entry.  
  
 You must choose **Set Applies-to ID** for all the entries that you want to apply before you choose **Post Application**.
