# How to: Combine Customer or Vendor Cards
The change double links feature enables you to combine two Customer or Vendor cards that belong to one customer or vendor.  
  
 The following procedure shows how to combine the information of two cards.  
  
### To combine information on vendor or customer cards  
  
1.  Open the Customer or Vendor card that you want to delete.  
  
2.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **History** group, choose **Combine Customers** or **Combine Vendors**. The **Combine Customer/Vendor** window opens. The **Old Vendor/Customer No.** field is filled in by default with the current Customer or Vendor card information that you want to delete.  
  
3.  Select a second Customer or Vendor card in the **New Customer No.** or **New Vendor No.** field. Click **OK**. The old Customer or Vendor card is deleted, and all documents with the old Customer or Vendor code are transferred to the new Customer or Vendor card.
