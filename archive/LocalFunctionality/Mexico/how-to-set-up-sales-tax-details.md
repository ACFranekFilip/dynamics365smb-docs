# How to: Set Up Sales Tax Details
The **Tax Details** window contains a matrix table that uses different combinations of sales tax jurisdictions and sales tax groups to establish sales tax rates. For each tax jurisdiction, you are advised to set up one tax group for normal sales tax, another tax group for items or services that are not taxed, and an additional tax group for every type of item or service that is handled with a different sales tax rate in that jurisdiction.  
  
 In the United States, when you sell to a customer at a location where you do not have a *situs*—or a legal location in that state—you do not collect sales tax. For locations in which you do not have a situs, ensure that both the **Tax Below Minimum** and **Tax Above Maximum** fields are 0.00.
