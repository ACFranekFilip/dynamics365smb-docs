# How to: Set Up Payment Terms
For each payment term, you can specify if the payment can be made in installments. For example, you can define that a payment can be made in three installments with a third of the payment due after 30, 60, and 90 days.  
  
 If a payment term must be paid in one installment, you must still specify how the due date will be calculated.  
  
### To set up payment terms  
  
1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Payment Terms**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Fill in the fields as described in the following table.  
  
    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Code**|Specify the unique identification code for the set of payment terms. You can enter a maximum of 10 alphanumeric characters.|  
    |**Payment Nos.**|Specify the number of installments allowed for this payment term.|  
    |**Description**|Specify the payment term code description. This description is printed where the payment terms are used.|  
  
3.  On the **Home** tab, in the **Process**, choose **Calculation**.  
  
4.  In the **Payment Terms Lines** window, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  
  
    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Payment %**|Specify the percentage of the total payment that this installment is for.<br /><br /> For example, if the payment must be made in one installment, specify **100**.|  
    |**Due Date Calculation**|Specify the formula that is used to calculate the date that a payment must be made.<br /><br /> For example, if the payment must be made in one installment after two weeks, specify **14D**. For more information, see [How to: Enter Dates and Times](../../FullExperience/WorkingWithDynamics/how-to-enter-dates-and-times.md).|  
    |**Discount Date Calculation**|Specify the formula that is used to calculate the date that a payment must be made in order to obtain a discount.|  
    |**Discount %**|Specify the discount percentage that is applied for early payment of an invoice amount.|  
  
5.  Choose the **OK** button.  
  
     The **Payment Nos.** field in the **Payment Terms** window is updated. The payment terms that you set here will be a reference for automatic due date calculation for documents that you post for relevant customers and vendors.
