# Configure a Company with the RapidStart Wizard
You can quickly configure a new company that you have created by using the ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[rim](../../includes/how-to-change-role-centers.md). Choose the RapidStart Profile ID.  
  
 In the following procedure, you have provided the customer with the configuration package, which is then installed on a computer. The customer opens the new company, which contains no customer data. You or the customer company follows the steps in the ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[rim](../../includes/rim_md.md)]--> wizard, which are described in this procedure, to provide basic information about the company. The wizard both imports the configuration package, and then applies the package to the company.  
  
### To configure a new company  
  
1.  On the ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[rim](../../includes/rim_md.md)]--> Role Center home page, on the **Home** tab, choose **RapidStart Wizard**.  
  
2.  Expand the **Step 1** FastTab, which contains general information about the new company. Enter the appropriate information about the new company in the fields. There is one field that you are required to fill out, **Name**. The rest of the fields are optional.  
  
       
  
3.  Expand the **Step 2** FastTab, which contains communication and contact information for the new company. Enter the appropriate information about the new company in the fields.  
  
4.  Expand the **Step 3** FastTab, which contains bank account and payment information for the new company. Enter the appropriate information about the new company in the fields.  
  
5.  Expand the **Step 4** FastTab. Choose the **AssistEdit** button to select the configuration package you want to apply. The name of the configuration package is displayed. You can then perform the following actions, in the listed order:  
  
    1.  Apply the configuration. On the **Actions** tab, choose **Apply Package**. This imports the configuration package and applies the package database data all at the same time.  
  
    2.  Review the configuration after it has been applied. This option lets you review configuration details and questionnaires provided by the partner and import some master data that is required for your company. On the **Actions** tab, choose **Configuration Worksheet**. For more information, see [Complete the Configuration Questionnaire](../how-to-complete-the-configuration-questionnaire.md).  
  
6.  Expand the **Step 5** FastTab. Specify which Role Center you want to be the default for the new company.  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  Only change your Role Center after you have completed configuration of the company. If you have more setup details to consider and modify, first use the configuration worksheet to continue your work. Then, return to the wizard to update your Role Center profile, or on the **Home** tab, choose **Complete Setup**.  
  
7.  Choose the **OK** button.  
  
8.  To verify that the configuration information has been applied to the new company, Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Company Information**, and then choose the related link.  
  
     The **Company Information** window contains information that you have specified. Choose the **OK** button to close the window.  
  
 At this point, you have configured the company, and applied data to it.
