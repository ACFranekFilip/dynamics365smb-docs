# How to: Set Up Employees
When you set up a new employee, there are fields that must always be filled in, fields that can be filled in as needed, and fields in which you cannot enter anything.  
  
### To set up an employee  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Employees**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Create a new employee card. On the **Home** tab, in the **New** group, choose **New**.  
  
3.  Fill in the fields on the card. The **No.** field is required.
