### To set up an alternative address for an employee  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Employees**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the relevant employee card.  
  
3.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Employee** group, choose **Alternative Addresses**.  
  
4.  Fill in the fields with the information for the alternative address.
