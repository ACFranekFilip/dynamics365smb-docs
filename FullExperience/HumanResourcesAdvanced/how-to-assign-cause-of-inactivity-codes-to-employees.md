# How to: Assign Cause of Inactivity Codes to Employees
You can use cause of inactivity codes to define various reasons for employee inactivity.  
  
 After you have set up the cause of inactivity codes, you can enter a code on the employee card for an employee that is inactive.  
  
### To assign a cause of inactivity code to an employee  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Employees**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Open the relevant employee card.  
  
3.  On the **Administration** FastTab, in the **Cause of Inactivity Code** field, select the relevant inactivity code.  
  
 Repeat the procedure for all employees that are inactive.
