# How to: Assign Relative Codes to Employees
You can set up relative codes for relatives or close contacts of your employees that you may want to contact in case of emergency.  
  
 After you have set up the relative codes, you can assign one or more codes to each employee.  
  
### To assign a relative code to an employee  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Employees**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the relevant employee.  
  
3.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Employee** group, choose **Relatives**.  
  
4.  In the **Employee Relatives** window, fill in as many lines as necessary to register the employeeâ€™s relatives that you want to have on record.
