# Assign Codes
In the Human Resources feature, you can assign various codes to your employees. Assigning codes enables you to quickly filter all the employees to view or report specific information. You can also search all employees for specific criteria. For example, if your company has a project to complete in France, you could determine which employees are fluent in French.  
  
 For each available category, you can set up an unlimited number of codes. For example, if you hire a new employee that belongs to a union not already defined, you can create a new code in the union table and assign it to this employee. You create new codes for all categories in the Setup section of Human Resources.  
  
 After you have setup the codes, you can assign them to the relevant employees.  
  
 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them. These tasks are listed in the order in which they are generally performed.
