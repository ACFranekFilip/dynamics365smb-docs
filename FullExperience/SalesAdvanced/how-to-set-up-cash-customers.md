# How to: Set Up Cash Customers
You cannot create an invoice without a customer number. This is true, even if you make a cash sale and do not have anything to record in a customer account.  
  
### To set up a cash customer  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Customer**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Create a new **Customer** card. On the **Home** tab, in the **New** group, choose **New**.  
  
3.  In the **No.** field, enter **Cash**, for example.  
  
4.  In the **Name** field, enter **Cash Sale**, for example.  
  
5.  On the **Invoicing** FastTab, fill in the **Customer Posting Group** and the **Gen. Bus. Posting Group** fields.  
  
 Now you have set up a customer that contains sufficient information for invoicing.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  You may have chosen a posting group that is also used for domestic credit sales. If you want to maintain separate data on cash sales, for example, with a special sales or receivables account, you can set up an extra posting group for this purpose.  
>   
>  You must enter a number for a receivables account for the posting group, even though the balance in this account will always be 0 after you post an invoice.
