# How to: Track Document Lines
You can use the document tracking to view documents that are related to sales order lines and purchase order lines for orders and archived orders. You can also see an overview of documents related to order lines. This helps you to identify documents used to process orders.  
  
 You can also track document lines using the following:  
  
-   Quotes  
  
-   Archived quotes  
  
-   Posted shipments  
  
-   Posted invoices  
  
 The following procedure describes how to track document lines from sales orders, but the same steps also apply to purchase orders and blanket orders.  
  
### To track document lines  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the relevant sales order, and then, on the **Home** tab, choose **Edit**.  
  
3.  Select the sales order line that will be used to track documents.
