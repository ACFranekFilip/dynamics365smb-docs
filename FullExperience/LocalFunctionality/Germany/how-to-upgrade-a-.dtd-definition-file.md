# How to: Upgrade a .DTD Definition File
You can explicitly validate a .dtd file after you import one in order to address upgrade issues. This is useful when you have an existing setup that needs to be updated to reflect the current version of Microsoft Dynamics NAV.  
  
### To upgrade and validate a .dtd file  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Data Exports**, and choose the related link.  
  
2.  On the **Home** tab, in the **Export** group, choose **Record Definitions**.  
  
3.  Set up a record definition, and then on the **Home** tab, in the **DTD** group, choose **Import**.  
  
4.  Select a file to import, and then in the **Process** group, choose **Validate**.
