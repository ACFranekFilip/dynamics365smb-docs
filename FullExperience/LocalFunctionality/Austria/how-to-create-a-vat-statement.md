# How to: Create a VAT Statement
[!INCLUDE[navnow](../../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)] allows you to submit a periodic report of VAT transactions. The VAT statement is submitted as a FDF file that corresponds with an editable PDF file from the tax authorities.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  You must fill in detailed information about your company address in the [Company Information](assetId:///45c9cfb7-ca1f-4323-99cd-9360a5631648) window before you create the VAT statement. This includes information about street, building, floor, and room number. This information is included in the FDF file.

1.  In the **Search** box, enter **VAT Statement AT**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.
