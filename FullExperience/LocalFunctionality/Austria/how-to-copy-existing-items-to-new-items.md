# How to: Copy Existing Items to New Items
You can group items with similar settings in an item catalog. When you add a new item, to save time, you can use **Copy Item** to copy an existing item to use as a template for a new item.  
  
### To copy existing items to new items  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the item that you want to copy, and then, on the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Copy Item**.  
  
3.  In the **\($ B\_11511 Item Copy $\)** window, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  
  
    |[!INCLUDE[bp_tablefield](../../ApplicationDesign/includes/bp_tablefield_md.md)]|[!INCLUDE[bp_tabledescription](../../ApplicationDesign/includes/bp_tabledescription_md.md)]|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Source Item No.**|Sets the item number from which the data is to be copied.|  
    |**Target Item No.**|Sets the item number for the item to which the data is to be copied.|  
    |**Target No. Series**|Sets the item number series to which the data is to be copied.|  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You can specify an item number in the **Target Item No.** field or in the **Target No. Series** field. The copy item will be assigned to the next available number in that number series.  
  
4.  Select the appropriate check boxes for the data that you want to copy.
