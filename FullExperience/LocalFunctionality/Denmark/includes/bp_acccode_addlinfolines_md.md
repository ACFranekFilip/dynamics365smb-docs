Customers in the public sector provide an account code when they place an order or requisition. If you enter an account code in the **Account Code** field for the individual lines, these account codes are included in the OIOUBL documents that you create in Microsoft Dynamics NAV. In accordance with **Lov om Offentlige Betalinger** and related statutes, the customer is entitled to withhold payment until they receive an invoice with the relevant account code.
