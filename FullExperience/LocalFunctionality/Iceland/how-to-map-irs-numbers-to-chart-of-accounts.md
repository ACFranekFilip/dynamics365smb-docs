2.  On the **Home** tab, choose **New**.  
  
3.  On the new line, enter a number in the **IRS number** field, and provide a name in the **Name** field.  
  
4.  Select the **Reverse Prefix** check box if you want the negative operator to be reversed on the balance of the general ledger account that the IRS number is mapped to.  
  
5.  Choose the **OK** button.
