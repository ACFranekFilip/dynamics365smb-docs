# How to: Set Up an Intangible Assets Account
The intangible assets accounting feature allows you to post intangible assets to a special account called the Intangible Assets account. Intangible assets are non\-monetary assets that cannot be physically measured. You can also include current expenses by using monthly depreciation.  
  
 The procedure for posting an intangible asset account is similar to the procedure used to post a fixed asset account.  
  
### To set up an intangible asset account  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select a fixed asset. In the **\($ N\_5600 Fixed Asset Card $\)** window, select **Intangible Asset** in the **\($ T\_5600\_12402 FA Type $\)** field.  
  
3.  Purchase and release the intangible asset. For more information, see [How to: Purchase and Release Undepreciable Fixed Assets](../../LocalFunctionalityForMicrosoftDynamicsNav2016/Russia/how-to-purchase-and-release-undepreciable-fixed-assets.md).  
  
4.  Print the **Receiving\-Transmission Act** report. In the **Search** box, enter **Intq. FA Rec.\-Tran. Act**, to print the unposted version of the report. Or, in the **Search** box, enter **Posted Intg. FA Rec.\-Tran. Act** to print the posted version of the report.  
  
5.  Print a legal Intangible FA Card HMA\-1 report. In the **Search** box, enter **Intangible FA Card HMA\-1**, and then choose the related link.  
  
6.  Choose the **Print** button to print the report or choose the **Preview** button to view it on the screen. Choose the **Cancel** button to save the information without printing the report.
