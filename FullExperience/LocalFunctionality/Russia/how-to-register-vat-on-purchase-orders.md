# How to: Register VAT on Purchase Orders
In Russia, organizations are required to keep a journal of received and issued VAT invoices. [!INCLUDE[navnow](../../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)] enables you to register VAT on purchase orders so that the information is tracked in the VAT invoices journal.  
  
### To register VAT on a purchase order  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Purchase Order**, and then choose the related link. Select the relevant purchase order.  
  
2.  On the **Shipping** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  
  
    |[!INCLUDE[bp_tablefield](../../ApplicationDesign/includes/bp_tablefield_md.md)]|[!INCLUDE[bp_tabledescription](../../ApplicationDesign/includes/bp_tabledescription_md.md)]|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Vendor Receipts No.**|Enter the identification number from the vendor receipt.|  
    |**Vendor Receipts Date**|Enter the date from the vendor receipt.|  
  
3.  On the **VAT** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  
  
    |[!INCLUDE[bp_tablefield](../../ApplicationDesign/includes/bp_tablefield_md.md)]|[!INCLUDE[bp_tabledescription](../../ApplicationDesign/includes/bp_tabledescription_md.md)]|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Vendor VAT Invoice No.**|Enter the invoice number from the original VAT transaction.|  
    |**Vendor VAT Invoice Date**|Enter the invoice date from the original VAT transaction.|  
    |**Vendor VAT Invoice Rcvd Date**|Enter the date that the purchase was received.|  
  
 The VAT transaction is now registered and will be tracked in the VAT invoices journal after the purchase order is posted.
