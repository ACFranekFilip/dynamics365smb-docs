# Dutch Post Codes
In the Netherlands, a company called Cendris delivers post code and post code updates for your business. These updates are important for marketing and relationship management activities. Each month Cendris delivers a file that has changes to the post code data for you to import into [!INCLUDE[navnow](../../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)].
