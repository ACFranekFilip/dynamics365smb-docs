# Payment Scenarios
Based on a sales or purchase invoice or credit memo a proposal can be generated and exported in order to be processed by our bank.  
  
 Using telebanking you can deal with three scenarios:  
  
1.  The payment is done by means of a bank account denominated in your local currency \(LCY\), which is the same currency as linked to the invoice\/credit memo.  
  
     For more information, see [Payment Scenario 1 \- Domestic Payments \(LCY to LCY\)](../../LocalFunctionalityForMicrosoftDynamicsNav2016/Netherlands/payment-scenario-1-domestic-payments-lcy-to-lcy-.md).  
  
2.  The payment is done by means of a bank account denominated in the same currency as the currency linked to the invoice\/credit memo. Both foreign.  
  
     For more information, see [Payment Scenario 2 \- Foreign Payment \(FCY to FCY\)](../../LocalFunctionalityForMicrosoftDynamicsNav2016/Netherlands/payment-scenario-2-foreign-payment-fcy-to-fcy-.md).  
  
3.  The payment is done by means of a bank account denominated in your local currency \(LCY\), while the invoice\/credit memo is linked to a foreign currency.  
  
     For more information, see [Payment Scenario 3 \- Foreign Payment \(LCY  to FCY\)](../../LocalFunctionalityForMicrosoftDynamicsNav2016/Netherlands/payment-scenario-3-foreign-payment-lcy-to-fcy-.md).
