# How to: Set Up Initial Item Costs
When you set up [!INCLUDE[navnow](../../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)], you must enter information about item costs that occurred before you began using [!INCLUDE[navnow](../../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)] in your organization.  
  
 In the **Before Start Item Cost** window, you can enter information about inventory items, such as component costs, routing costs, and overhead costs.  
  
### To set up initial item costs  
  
1.  In the **Search** field, enter **Before Start Item Cost**, and then select the related link.  
  
2.  On the **Home** tab, choose **New**.  
  
3.  Enter information into the required fields. This includes the **Starting Date**, **Purchase Quantity**, **Purchase Amount**, **Production Quantity**, and **Production Amount** fields.  
  
4.  Choose the **OK** button.  
  
 The entries in this window will be used to calculate the average year cost. For more information, see [Item Cost History List](../../LocalFunctionalityForMicrosoftDynamicsNav2016/Italy/-$-n_12118-item-cost-history-list-$-.md) and [Calculate End Year Costs](../../LocalFunctionalityForMicrosoftDynamicsNav2016/Italy/-$-b_12115-calculate-end-year-costs-$-.md).
