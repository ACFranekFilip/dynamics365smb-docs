# How to: Set Up Compressed Depreciation of Fixed Assets
You can compress fixed asset depreciation into subclasses and choose to display only the total sum by subclass. You can choose to post only the depreciation totals of assets that are grouped by category. This is particularly important for companies that have multiple fixed assets divided into many individual items.  
  
 When you calculate depreciation, one line is generated for each fixed asset. For example, posting depreciations for 100 assets generates 100 lines that are posted to both the general ledger and fixed asset ledger entries.  
  
### To set up compressed depreciation of fixed assets  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Depreciation Books**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **\($ N\_5611 Depreciation Book List $\)** window, select the relevant depreciation book, and then, on the **Home** tab, choose **Edit**.  
  
3.  To post only the depreciation totals of assets that are grouped by category, in the **\($ N\_5610 Depreciation Book Card $\)** window, on the **General** FastTab, select the **Compress Depreciation** check box.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  Multiple depreciation lines are then compressed in the general ledger and are displayed in a single entry that is divided by fixed asset categories.  
  
4.  Choose the **OK** button.
