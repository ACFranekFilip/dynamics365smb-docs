# How to: Submit VAT Statements
Companies must pay VAT for most purchased goods and services. VAT can be deducted if the goods and services that are purchased by a company are used in the production of its income.  
  
 You must submit periodic VAT statements to the tax authorities to list transactions that include VAT with amounts over a specific threshold. Before you submit your VAT statement, you should review the VAT statement, and then settle and post the VAT transactions.  
  
### To review and print VAT statements  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **VAT Statements**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **VAT Statement** window, in the **Name** field, select the required VAT statement, and then, on the **Home** tab, in the **Process** group, choose **Print**.  
  
3.  On the **Options** FastTab, enter a date interval to limit the period covered by the statement and define what type of VAT entries that you want to include.  
  
4.  Choose the **Print** button to print the VAT statement.  
  
 You can use the printed VAT statement to review the VAT entries to be submitted to the tax authorities.  
  
### To settle and post VAT transactions  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Calc. and Post VAT Settlement**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  On the **Options** FastTab, enter a date interval to limit the period covered by the VAT settlement, select the correct VAT settlement account, and then select **Post** if you want to post the VAT amounts to the settlement account.  
  
3.  Choose the **Print** button to print the VAT settlement and post the entries.  
  
 After you calculate and post the VAT settlement, VAT amounts are transferred to the appropriate VAT settlement accounts.
