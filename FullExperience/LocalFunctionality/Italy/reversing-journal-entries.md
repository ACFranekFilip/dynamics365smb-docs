# Reversing Journal Entries
Controls have been added to the **\($ N\_179 Reverse Transaction Entries $\)** window to comply with local laws. These controls ensure the following:  
  
-   You cannot reverse an invoice, credit note, or document involving VAT management.  
  
-   You cannot reverse posted invoices, credit memos, or debit memos.  
  
-   You cannot delete posted invoices, credit memos, or general journals in the sales, purchase, or service areaâ€”even if they have been printed.  
  
-   You cannot reverse sales, purchase, or service headers for reserved documents.
