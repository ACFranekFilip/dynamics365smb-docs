# How to: Associate GIFI Codes with Chart of Accounts
To report financial information by General Index of Financial Information \(GIFI\) code, each GIFI code must be associated with the appropriate accounts in the chart of accounts.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  You must set up the GIFI codes in the **\($ N\_10015 GIFI Code $\)** window before associating them with your chart of accounts. For more information, see [How to: Set Up GIFI Codes](../../LocalFunctionalityForMicrosoftDynamicsNav2016/Canada/how-to-set-up-gifi-codes.md).  
  
### To associate GIFI codes with chart of accounts  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the general ledger account. On the **Home** tab, choose **Edit**.  
  
3.  On the **Cost Accounting** FastTab, in the **GIFI Code** field, select an appropriate GIFI code.  
  
4.  Choose the **OK** button.
