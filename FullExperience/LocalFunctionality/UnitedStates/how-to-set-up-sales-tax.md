# How to: Set Up Sales Tax
In [!INCLUDE[navnow](../../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)], you need to set the tax calculation type before you can set up sales tax.  
  
### To set up sales tax  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Tax Posting Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the tax. On the **Home** tab, in the **Manage** group, choose **Edit**.  
  
     In the **Tax Calculation Type** field, select **Sales Tax**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  Leave the remaining fields blank. Sales tax is not calculated if the **Tax Calculation Type** field is set to **Normal VAT**, and the **VAT in Use** check box in the **General Ledger Setup** window is not selected.  
  
3.  Choose the **OK** button.
