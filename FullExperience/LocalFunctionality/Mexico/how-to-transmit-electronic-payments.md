# How to: Transmit Electronic Payments
After you have exported payment journal entries to a file using the [Export Electronic Payments](../../LocalFunctionalityForMicrosoftDynamicsNav2016/Canada/-$-r_10083-export-electronic-payments-$-.md) report, you can use the [Void\-Transmit Elec. Payments](../../LocalFunctionalityForMicrosoftDynamicsNav2016/Canada/-$-b_10084-void-transmit-elec.-payments-$-.md) process to transmit the electronic payments file to your bank for processing.  
  
### To transmit payments  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Payment Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  On the **Navigate** FastTab, choose **Electronic Payments**, and then choose **Transmit** or **Void**.  
  
3.  In the **Void\/Transmit Elec. Payments** window, on the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  
  
    |[!INCLUDE[bp_tablefield](../../ApplicationDesign/includes/bp_tablefield_md.md)]|[!INCLUDE[bp_tabledescription](../../ApplicationDesign/includes/bp_tabledescription_md.md)]|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Bank Account No.**|Select the bank account for the electronic payment operation.|  
    |**E\-Pay Operation**|Specifies if you want to transmit or void the electronic payment file. The **Transmit** option produces an electronic payment file to be transmitted to your bank for processing. The **Void** option voids the exported file. Confirm that the correct selection has been made before you process the electronic payment file.|  
  
4.  To transmit the payments, choose the **OK** button.  
  
     After transmitting the electronic payments, post the payment journal.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If you want to void a check after the journal has been transmitted and posted, you must contact your bank. You can then void the individual pieces of remittance advice from the **Check Ledger Entries** table. For more information, see [How to: Void Posted Checks](../../LocalFunctionalityForMicrosoftDynamicsNav2016/Canada/how-to-void-posted-checks.md).
