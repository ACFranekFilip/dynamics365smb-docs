# How to: Delete Simulation Entries
You can create and post simulation entries to the general ledger without affecting the real accounting, and you can delete the simulated entries.  
  
### To delete simulation entries  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **\($ N\_10810 Simulation Registers $\)**, and then choose the relevant link.  
  
2.  Select the simulation register that you want to delete.  
  
3.  On the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Delete**.  
  
     This deletes the register entry and the general ledger entries that are linked to it. A dialog box appears in which you must choose the **Yes**  button to confirm.
