# How to: Reopen Accounting Periods
When a single fiscal period has been fiscally closed it might be necessary to reopen it to post general ledger entries.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  After the year that the accounting period belongs to is fiscally closed, you cannot reopen it.  
  
### To reopen accounting periods  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Accounting Periods**, and then choose the relevant link.  
  
2.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Fiscal Closing** group, choose **Reopen Fiscal Period**.  
  
     If more than one fiscal period is fiscally closed, the last one should be reopened. A message appears that identifies the period that should be reopened and explains the consequences of reopening it.  
  
3.  To fiscally open the period, choose the **Yes** button.  
  
 When the period is reopened, the [Fiscally Closed](../../LocalFunctionalityForMicrosoftDynamicsNav2016/France/-$-t_50_10800-fiscally-closed-$-.md) field is cleared, and the [Period Reopened Date](../../LocalFunctionalityForMicrosoftDynamicsNav2016/France/-$-t_50_10802-period-reopened-date-$-.md) field is updated for the period.
