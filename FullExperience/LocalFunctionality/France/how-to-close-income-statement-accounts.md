# How to: Close Income Statement Accounts
Before you can run the **Close Income Statement** batch job, you must close the fiscal year. For more information, see [How to: Fiscally Close Years](../../LocalFunctionalityForMicrosoftDynamicsNav2016/France/how-to-fiscally-close-years.md).  
  
### To close the income statement accounts  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Close Income Statement**, and then choose the relevant link.  
  
2.  In the **Close Income Statement** window, on the **Options** FastTab, specify the conditions of the batch job.  
  
3.  Choose the **OK** button.  
  
     When the batch job is finished, you must close the accounts.  
  
4.  In the **Search** box, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the relevant link.  
  
5.  Select the general journal that contains the closing entries.  
  
6.  Enter one line with a balancing entry that posts the net income to the correct general ledger account under ownersâ€™ equity on the balance sheet.  
  
7.  On the **Home** tab, in the **Process** group, choose **Post** to post the journal.
