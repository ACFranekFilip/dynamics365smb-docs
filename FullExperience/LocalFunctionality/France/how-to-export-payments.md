The Payment Management module allows you to export your payments electronically via a text file or XMLport.  
  
### To export payments  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Payment Slip Setup**, and then choose the relevant link.  
  
2.  In the **\($ N\_10864 Payment Class $\)** window, select a payment class, and then, on the **Actions** tab, in the **General** group, choose **Steps**.  
  
3.  In the **\($ N\_10866 Payment Step $\)** window, fill in the **\($ T\_10862\_3 Name $\)** field.  
  
4.  On the **Home** tab, in the **Manage** group, choose **Edit** to open.

6.  In the **\($ T\_10862\_6 Action Type $\)** field, select **File**, and then in the **Export Type.** field, select **Report** or **XMLport**.  
  
7.  In the **\($ T\_10862\_8 Export No. $\)** field, specify the object that will export the payments.
