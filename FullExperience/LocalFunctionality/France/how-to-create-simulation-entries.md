# How to: Create Simulation Entries
When you have set up simulation of general ledger entries, you can create simulation entries.  
  
### To create simulation entries  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **General Journal**, and then choose the relevant link.  
  
2.  Select the general journal template which has been set up for the Simulation functionality.  
  
3.  Select a general journal batch in the **Batch Name** field.  
  
4.  Create your transactions as in any journal.  
  
5.  Post the journal.  
  
6.  To see the results of posting, in the **Search** box, enter **Simulation Registers**, and then choose the related link.  
  
7.  Select the most recent register, and then, on the **Navigate** tab, choose **General Ledger**.
