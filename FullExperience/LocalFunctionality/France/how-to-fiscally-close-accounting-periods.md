# How to: Fiscally Close Accounting Periods
When a fiscal period is complete, you can fiscally close the period to make sure that no more general ledger entries can be posted.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  When a period is being closed, any simulation entries that may exist are found and deleted.  
  
### To fiscally close accounting periods  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **\($ N\_100 Accounting Periods $\)**, and then choose the relevant link.  
  
2.  In the **\($ N\_100 Accounting Periods $\)** window, on the **Navigate** tab, in the **Fiscal Closing** group, choose **Close Fiscal Period**.  
  
     If more than one fiscal period is not fiscally closed, the earliest one should be fiscally closed. A message appears to identify the period that should be closed and explains the consequences of closing it.  
  
3.  To fiscally close the period, choose the **Yes** button.  
  
 When the period is fiscally closed, the [\($ T\_50\_10800 Fiscally Closed $\)](../../LocalFunctionalityForMicrosoftDynamicsNav2016/France/-$-t_50_10800-fiscally-closed-$-.md) field is selected, and the [\($ T\_50\_10801 Fiscal Closing Date $\)](../../LocalFunctionalityForMicrosoftDynamicsNav2016/France/-$-t_50_10801-fiscal-closing-date-$-.md) field is updated for the period.
