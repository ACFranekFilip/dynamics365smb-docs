# How to: File Non-Euro SEPA Payments
In [!INCLUDE[navnow](../../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)], you can file non\-euro SEPA payments with the bank. This is useful when you make payments to other countries that do not use SEPA and for currencies other than the euro.  
  
 Before you can file a non\-euro SEPA payment you must complete the following administration tasks:  
  
-   Set up a new export protocol for a non\-euro SEPA. For more information, see [\($ T\_2000005 Export Protocol $\)](../../LocalFunctionalityForMicrosoftDynamicsNav2016/Belgium/-$-t_2000005-export-protocol-$-.md).  
  
-   In the **\($ T\_9 Country\/Region $\)** table, clear the **\($ T\_9\_2000005 SEPA Allowed $\)** field for each country that belongs to the EEA zone.  
  
-   Verify that the **\($ T\_98\_2000000 Currency Euro $\)** field in the **\($ T\_98 General Ledger Setup $\)** table is not in euro currency.  
  
-   Verify that the vendorâ€™s **\($ T\_23\_288 Preferred Bank Account $\)** field in the **\($ T\_23 Vendor $\)** table contains the IBAN and SWIFT code.
