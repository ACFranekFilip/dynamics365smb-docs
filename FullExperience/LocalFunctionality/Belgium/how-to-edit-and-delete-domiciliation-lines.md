# How to: Edit and Delete Domiciliation Lines
After you have generated domiciliation suggestions, you may want to change the domiciliations lines. For example, you may want to reassign a bank account or prevent payment for a specific customer or customer ledger entry.  
  
 After you have modified the journal lines, print the **Domiciliation Journal \- Test** report to test all journal lines.  
  
 The **Suggest Domiciliations** batch job creates domiciliation suggestions for all customers matching the specified criteria.  
  
### To edit a journal line  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Domiciliation Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **Batch Name** field, select the required journal batch.  
  
3.  Select the journal line, and edit the fields.  
  
### To delete a journal line  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Domiciliation Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **Batch Name** field, select the required journal batch.  
  
3.  Select the journal line, and on the **Home** tab, in the **Manage** group, choose **Delete**.
