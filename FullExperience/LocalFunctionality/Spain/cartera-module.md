# Cartera Module
The Cartera module allows you to use specific documents, such as bills of exchange and promissory notes, to manage customer and vendor payments.  
  
 You can use the Cartera module to manage transactions made with different financial units based on:  
  
-   Document type  
  
-   Cost  
  
-   Credit limit  
  
 The balances are kept in local currencies and original currencies.  
  
 The Cartera module contains the Receivables Cartera module and the Payments Cartera module. The Receivables Cartera module allows you to manage bills generated from sales invoices. The Payments Cartera module allows you to manage payables documents generated from purchase invoices or from the Cartera journal.
