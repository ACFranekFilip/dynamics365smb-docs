# How to: Print Intrastat Reports
All European Union \(EU\) companies must submit an Intrastat statistics report to the Instituto Nacional de Estatística \(INE\) detailing their trade with other EU countries\/regions. Companies do not have to submit statistical declarations for the Intrastat system if their import and export totals are lower than the threshold set by their country\/region.  
  
 You can print and send required trade information in a file format approved by the tax authorities.
