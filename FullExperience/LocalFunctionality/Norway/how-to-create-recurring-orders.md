### To create recurring orders  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Create Recurring Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  
  
    |[!INCLUDE[bp_tablefield](../../ApplicationDesign/includes/bp_tablefield_md.md)]|[!INCLUDE[bp_tabledescription](../../ApplicationDesign/includes/bp_tabledescription_md.md)]|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**\($ B\_15000300\_F\_1\_1 Processing Date $\)**|Enter the date to process the blanket orders.|  
    |**\($ B\_15000300\_F\_1\_3 Create only latest $\)**|Select to create only the latest recurring order for the blanket orders processed. This option overrides the equivalent option for the recurring group.|
