# How to: Create Manual Remittance Payments
Generally, payments are created automatically in the payment journal using the remittance suggestion function. However, you can also create a payment manually, either as a payment of an existing invoice or as a payment without a link to an existing invoice, such as a payment to a vendor.  
  
### To create a manual remittance payment  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Payment Info**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **\($ N\_15000001 Payment Info $\)** window, on the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Initialize payment info**.  
  
     If the payment is linked to an existing vendor ledger entry, information will be transferred from the entry. If the payment is not linked to a vendor ledger entry, only partial information will be created.  
  
3.  Choose the **OK** button.
