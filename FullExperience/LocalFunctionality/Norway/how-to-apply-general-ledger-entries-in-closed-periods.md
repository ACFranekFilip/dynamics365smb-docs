# How to: Apply General Ledger Entries in Closed Periods
[!INCLUDE[navnow](../../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)] allows you to post entries after a posting period is closed, even if no actual posting is performed during that period. You can also choose the users who will make these entries.  
  
### To apply an entry in a closed period  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  On the **General** FastTab, select the **Application always Allowed** check box to apply entries outside the allowed posting period.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  By default, the **Application always Allowed** check box is not selected.  
  
3.  Choose the **OK** button.  
  
4.  In the **Search** box, enter **User Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
  
5.  In the **User Setup** window, select the **Application always Allowed** check box for each user who can apply entries to a closed period.  
  
6.  Choose the **OK** button.
