# How to: Print Troubleshooting Reports
The following troubleshooting reports are available to assist Microsoft Certified Partners with troubleshooting issues:  
  
-   **License Information** report – This report contains the license number, the name of the licensed user, which application granules they have purchased, and when the license expires, if applicable.  
  
-   **Data Dictionary** report \(report \#10315\) – This report allows you to print detailed table reference, field reference, and table properties for table objects.  
  
 You must have access to the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_long](../../BusinessFunctionality/DataExchange/includes/nav_dev_long_md.md)] and a license that grants access to **Object Designer**, which is available only to administrators.  
  
 You can print these reports and send them to your Microsoft Certified Partner to help resolve issues with your [!INCLUDE[navnow](../../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)] implementation.  
  
### To print the License Information report  
  
1.  In the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_short](../../LocalFunctionalityForMicrosoftDynamicsNav2016/Canada/includes/nav_dev_short_md.md)], on the **Tools** menu, choose **License Information**.  
  
2.  In the **License Information** window, you can preview the license information, or you can choose the **Export** button to print the **License Information** report.  
  
### To print the Data Dictionary report  
  
1.  In the [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_short](../../LocalFunctionalityForMicrosoftDynamicsNav2016/Canada/includes/nav_dev_short_md.md)], on the **Tools** menu, choose **Object Designer**.  
  
2.  Choose the **Report** button.  
  
3.  In the **Type** column, find **ID** 10315, which is the **Data Dictionary** report.  
  
4.  In the **Object Designer** window, choose the **Run** button to open the **Data Dictionary** report.  
  
5.  On the **Options** tab, enter the relevant information into the fields.  
  
6.  Choose the **Print** button to print the report or choose the **Preview** button to view it on the screen.
