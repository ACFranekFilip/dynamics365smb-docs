# Payments in Cash
As of January 1, 2012, companies in Spain are required to submit a summary for payments in cash that are greater than EUR 6.000.00 for each customer for each year.  
  
## Reporting Payments in Cash  
 If you are reporting payments in cash, the following sequence of tasks are listed in the order in which they are generally performed:  
  
-   Applying payments in cash to invoices.  
  
-   Making 340 Payments in cash declaration.  
  
### Applying Payments in Cash to Invoices  
 You apply payments in cash to invoices that you have received from customers. For information about how to apply payments to invoices, see [How to: Apply Customer Ledger Entries](../../Finance/how-to-apply-customer-ledger-entries.md). Only the applied payments in cash are used for reporting payments in cash. If you do not apply payments in cash to invoices, you cannot report payments in cash.  
  
### Making 340 Payments in Cash Declaration  
 You use the **\($ B\_10743 Make 340 Declaration $\)** batch job to report 340 payments in cash declaration. For information about how to specify and select information to generate the declaration, see [\($ B\_10743 Make 340 Declaration $\)](../../LocalFunctionalityForMicrosoftDynamicsNav2016/Spain/-$-b_10743-make-340-declaration-$-.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The payments made through banks are excluded.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The amount received in cash in the declaration .txt file can contain values that differ from the total invoiced amount for a customer. This is because not all of the payments are made in cash.
