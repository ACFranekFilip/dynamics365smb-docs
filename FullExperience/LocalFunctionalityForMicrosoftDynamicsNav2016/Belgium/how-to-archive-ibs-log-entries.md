# How to: Archive IBS Log Entries
IBS log lines that have a process status of **Processed** can be archived. IBS logs contain information about electronic banking files that are created during Isabel electronic bank transfers.  
  
 Isabel is a third\-party software program that is frequently used in Belgium to manage and transfer electronic banking files. Isabel currently supports bank transactions, such as SEPA credit transfers, automated bank orders, and CODA files.  
  
### To archive an IBS log entry  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **IBS Logs**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the line that you want to archive. On the **Actions** tab, in the **Function** group, choose **Archive**.  
  
3.  A message appears asking if you want to archive the IBS log records.  
  
4.  Choose the **Yes** button.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The **\($ T\_2000010\_21 Process Status $\)** field for the line will now be **Archived**. You can delete a record with a status of **Archived**.
