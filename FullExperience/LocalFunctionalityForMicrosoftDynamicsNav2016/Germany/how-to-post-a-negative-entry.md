# How to: Post a Negative Entry
You can use the **Correction** field to post a negative debit instead of a credit, or to post a negative credit instead of a debit on an account. To meet legal requirements, this field is visible by default in all journals. The **Debit Amount** and **Credit Amount** fields include both the original entry, and the corrected entry. These fields have no effect on the account balance.  
  
### To post a negative entry  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link  
  
2.  In the **Batch Name** field, select the required batch name.  
  
3.  Enter information into the relevant fields.  
  
4.  In the journal line that you want to activate for negative entries, select the **Correction** check box.  
  
5.  To post the journal, on the **Home** tab, in the **Process** group, choose **Post**, and then choose the **Yes** button.
