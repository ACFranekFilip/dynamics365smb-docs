|New and changed features|[!INCLUDE[bp_tabledescription](../../ApplicationDesign/includes/bp_tabledescription_md.md)]|See|  
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------|  
|Reconcile FIK payments|In the **\($ N\_1290 Payment Reconciliation Journal $\)** window, you can import a file with FIK payments recorded in your electronic bank and automatically apply each payment in the file to its related unpaid sales invoice based on a matching of the unique FIK reference number.<br /><br /> The feature works in a similar way as the features in the generic version of [!INCLUDE[dyn_nav](../../ApplicationDesign/includes/dyn_nav_md.md)] to import bank statements and reconcile payments using automatic application. When you choose the **Import FIK Statement** action, the FIK payments are imported and payments are automatically applied as suggestions that you can edit before you post the applied payments. The quality of each application is specified by six different types of FIK detail in the **\($ T\_274\_23 Transaction Text $\)** field in the **\($ N\_1290 Payment Reconciliation Journal $\)** window.|[How to: Reconcile Payments Using Automatic Application](../../Finance/how-to-reconcile-payments-using-automatic-application.md)<br /><br /> [FIK Details in the Payment Reconciliation Journal](../../LocalFunctionalityForMicrosoftDynamicsNav2016/Denmark/fik-details-in-the-payment-reconciliation-journal.md)|
