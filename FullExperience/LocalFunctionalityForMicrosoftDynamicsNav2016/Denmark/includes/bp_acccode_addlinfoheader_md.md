Customers in the public sector provide an account code when they place an order or requisition. Based on the value of the [\($ T\_18\_13601 Account Code $\)](../../../LocalFunctionalityForMicrosoftDynamicsNav2016/Denmark/-$-t_18_13601-account-code-$-.md) field, the account code is included in the OIOUBL documents that you create in Microsoft Dynamics NAV. In accordance with **Lov om Offentlige Betalinger** and related statutes, the customer is entitled to withhold payment until they receive an invoice with the relevant account code.
