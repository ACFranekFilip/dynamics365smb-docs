# How to: Calculate Goods and Services Tax on Prepayments
When a partial payment or prepayment is made, you must calculate Goods and Services Tax \(GST\) for that partial payment or prepayment based on the total invoice amount, instead of on a partial amount. If you account for GST on a non\-cash basis, you must report and pay GST on payments during the period in which you receive partial payment or issue a tax invoice for payment.  
  
### To calculate GST on prepayments  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  On the **Local Functionalities** FastTab, select the **Full GST on Prepayment** check box to calculate GST for the total invoice amount when a prepayment invoice is posted.  
  
3.  Choose the **OK** button.
