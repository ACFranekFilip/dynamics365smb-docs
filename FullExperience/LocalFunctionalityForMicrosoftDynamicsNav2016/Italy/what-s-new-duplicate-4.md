# What&#39;s New-duplicate 4
[!INCLUDE[navnow](../../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)] provides many features and enhancements for Italy.  
  
## New and Changed Features in the Italian version of [!INCLUDE[navnow](../../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)]  
  
|New and changed features|Description|See|  
|------------------------------|-----------------|---------|  
|Blacklist Transactions|In Italy, organizations must report, by electronic means, all transactions that are carried out with persons or organizations having their residence or domicile in a blacklist country\/region. The law requires that all Italian VAT\-registered organizations periodically report transaction details to the Italian Revenue Service to help prevent VAT fraud. Transactions subject to blacklist reporting include the following:<br /><br /> -   **Purchases of Goods**<br />-   **Sales of Goods**<br />-   **Purchases of Services**<br />-   **Sales of Services**<br /><br /> How you set up a Blacklist Communication report has changed to accommodate changes in the Italian regulations.|[\($ N\_12110 Blacklist Communication $\)](../../LocalFunctionalityForMicrosoftDynamicsNav2016/Italy/-$-n_12110-blacklist-communication-$-.md)|  
|VAT Data Transmission Appointment Codes|With this release of [!INCLUDE[navnow](../../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)], unified support for appointment codes is enabled for the various reports that describe VAT transactions. The implementation of the support for appointment codes for VAT reports and Blacklist Communication reports has been redesigned with the goal of creating one user experience that customers can use with both types of reports.|[\($ N\_12125 Appointment Codes $\)](../../LocalFunctionalityForMicrosoftDynamicsNav2016/Italy/-$-n_12125-appointment-codes-$-.md)|  
|VAT Transaction Report for the Tax Authorities|Every year the Italian tax authorities require Italian companies to print fiscal reports listing all of the posted ledger entries.<br /><br /> Reporting requirements have been updated. For example, threshold amounts at which transactions must be reported have changed. Consequently, the Italian VAT reports have been modified. The transactions that are impacted are invoices and credit memos for customers and vendors.|[Italian VAT](../../LocalFunctionalityForMicrosoftDynamicsNav2016/Italy/italian-vat.md)|  
|CBI SEPA Format|In addition to the standard SEPA formats, [!INCLUDE[navnow](../../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)] also provides support for the Italian CBI SEPA format, v.00.04.00, Payment Request, for payments to vendors. New export options have been added to  the **\($ N\_12190 Vendor Bill List Sent Card $\)** window. In addition, XMLport 12100 is provided.|[\($ N\_12190 Vendor Bill List Sent Card $\)](../../LocalFunctionalityForMicrosoftDynamicsNav2016/Italy/-$-n_12190-vendor-bill-list-sent-card-$-.md)|
