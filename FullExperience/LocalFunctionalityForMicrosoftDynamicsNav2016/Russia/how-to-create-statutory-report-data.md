# How to: Create Statutory Report Data
After you have defined the statutory reports that are required by the tax authorities, you can create the report data and generate files that you can submit to the authorities.  
  
### To create report data  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **\($ N\_26550 Statutory Reports $\)**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the statutory report that you want to create data for, and then, on the **Actions** tab, choose **Create Report Data**.  
  
3.  In the **\($ N\_26574 Create Report Data $\)** window, fill in the fields.  
  
     The **\($ N\_26574\_1210020 Creation Date $\)** field is automatically set to the work date, but you can change this.  
  
     The **\($ N\_26574\_1210042 Periodicity $\)** field is set depending on the value of the **\($ T\_26550\_14 Report Type $\)** field for the report.  
  
4.  Choose the **OK** button.  
  
 This generates data for the report. Now, you can verify the data before you submit the statutory report.  
  
### To verify report data  
  
1.  In the **\($ N\_26550 Statutory Reports $\)** window, select the statutory report that you want to create data for, and on the **Actions** tab, choose **Report Data**.  
  
     The **\($ N\_26562 Report Data List $\)** window contains a line for each set of report data that you have created for this statutory report.  
  
2.  In the **\($ N\_26562 Report Data List $\)** window, select the set of report data that you want to verify, and on the **Actions** tab, choose **Overview**.  
  
3.  In the **\($ N\_26563 Statutory Report Data Overview $\)** window, set the appropriate filters, and on the **Actions** tab, choose **Show Data**.  
  
     This opens a window that displays the data based on your filters. You can verify the report data before you generate the files for the statutory report. If you want to make changes, you must create the report data again.  
  
4.  After you have verified that the report data is correct, choose the **OK** button.  
  
     You can repeat these steps for all combinations of filters.  
  
 Now, you can submit the report by generating a file that is based on the setup for the statutory report.  
  
## Generating Statutory Reports  
 Before you generate a statutory report, you should verify that the data is correct in the **\($ N\_26562 Report Data List $\)** window. Also, you should make sure that the statutory report is set up correctly in the **\($ N\_26550 Statutory Reports $\)** window. Before you do this, you must release the report data.  
  
#### To release the report data for a statutory report  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **\($ N\_26550 Statutory Reports $\)**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the statutory report that you want to generate, and on the **Actions** tab, choose **Report Data**.  
  
3.  Select the report data, and then, on the **Actions** tab, choose **Release**.  
  
 Now, you can generate the statutory report.  
  
#### To generate a statutory report  
  
1.  In the **\($ N\_26550 Statutory Reports $\)** window, select the statutory report that you want to generate, and on the **Actions** tab, choose **Report Data**.  
  
     Depending on the statutory report, you must export to Microsoft Excel or generate an XML file.  
  
2.  To export to Microsoft Excel, select the report data, and then, on the **Actions** tab, choose **Export to Excel**.  
  
     This creates a Microsoft Excel workbook that has the data that you created for this statutory report.  
  
3.  To export to an XML file, select the report data, and then, on the **Actions** tab, choose **Export Electronic File**.  
  
     This creates an XML file that has the data that you created for this statutory report.  
  
 Now, you can submit the report. For more information, see [Statutory Reporting Directives](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=216142) on the Federal Tax Services website.
