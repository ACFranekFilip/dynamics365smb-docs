# Fixed Asset Charges
In [!INCLUDE[navnow](../../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)], you can use fixed asset charges to include additional charges on the purchase of fixed assets in the fixed asset acquisition cost. For more information, see [How to: Create a Fixed Asset Charge](../../LocalFunctionalityForMicrosoftDynamicsNav2016/Russia/how-to-create-a-fixed-asset-charge.md).  
  
 You can change the fixed asset acquisition cost in the following scenarios:  
  
-   After service  
  
-   Repair  
  
-   Modernization  
  
-   Partial write\-off  
  
-   Revaluation  
  
 In addition, you can also specify how the fixed asset will be depreciated. You can use various depreciation methods for your fixed assets. If you want to depreciate one or more fixed assets by several depreciation methods, you must set up multiple fixed asset depreciation methods.
