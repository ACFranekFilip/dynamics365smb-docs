# How to: Copy Profiles
Use the **Copy Profile** window when you want to create a copy of an existing profile. This can save you time if you want to use similar settings on a profile and you only want to change a few settings.  
  
### To copy a profile  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Profiles**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  On the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Copy Profile**.  
  
3.  In the **New Profile ID** field, enter a name for the profile that you want to copy.  
  
4.  Choose the **OK** button to copy the profile.
