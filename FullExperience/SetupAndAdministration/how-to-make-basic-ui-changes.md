# How to: Make Basic UI Changes
As basic types of UI personalization, you can change the size and position of any window, the width of columns and the height of column headers, and you can change the sorting of data in columns.  
  
 You can cancel your basic UI changes by opening the **Reset User\-Specified Settings** window from your Role Center. For more information, see [How to: Cancel Basic UI Changes and File Handling Decisions](../SetupAndAdministration/how-to-cancel-basic-ui-changes-and-file-handling-decisions.md).  
  
 You perform the main types of UI personalization in the **Customize** window. For more information, see [Personalize the User Interface](../SetupAndAdministration/-$-s_personalization-personalize-the-user-interface-$-.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The following procedure does not describe how to resize windows and columns by dragging as that is considered basic behavior of programs running on Microsoft Windows.  
  
### To change the height of column headers  
  
1.  On a page with a grid, open the shortcut menu for any column header, point to **Choose Header Height**, and then choose ether **1**, **2**, or **3**.  
  
2.  Open the shortcut menu for the any column header again, and then choose **Apply to All Lists** to specify that the selection you made in step 1 applies to grids in all pages in your instance of [!INCLUDE[dyn_nav](../ApplicationDesign/includes/dyn_nav_md.md)].  
  
### To change the sorting of data in columns  
  
1.  On a page with a grid, choose a column header to make the sorting button appear, and then choose the sorting button to sort data in the column in the opposite direction.  
  
     Alternatively, open the shortcut menu for the column header, and then choose either **Ascending** or **Descending**.  
  
 For more information, see [Sorting](../WorkingWithDynamics/sorting.md).
