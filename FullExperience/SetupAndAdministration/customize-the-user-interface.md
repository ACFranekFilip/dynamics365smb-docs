# Customize the User Interface
The concept of UI customization in [!INCLUDE[dyn_nav](../ApplicationDesign/includes/dyn_nav_md.md)] is divided in two:  
  
-   Configuration, performed by the administrator  
  
-   Personalization, performed by users  
  
 The administrator configures the user interface for multiple users by customizing the user interface for a profile that the users are assigned to.  
  
 Users personalize the user interface of their personal version of the profile by customizing the user interface under their own user logon.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Only the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](../BusinessFunctionality/IntegratingWithMicrosoftOffice/includes/nav_windows_md.md)] can be customized. However, customizations made in the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](../BusinessFunctionality/IntegratingWithMicrosoftOffice/includes/nav_windows_md.md)] as configuration are reflected in the web client.  
  
 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them. These tasks are listed in the order in which they are generally performed.

|As an administrator, remove UI elements according to permissions. Then, configure different profile\-specific page layouts using the same UI customization functions that users use.|[Configure the User Interface](../SetupAndAdministration/configure-the-user-interface.md)|  
|As a user, change how actions, fields, and page parts are placed in your personal version of [!INCLUDE[dyn_nav](../ApplicationDesign/includes/dyn_nav_md.md)] using a rich set of UI customization functions.|[\($ S\_PERSONALIZATION Personalize the User Interface $\)](../SetupAndAdministration/-$-s_personalization-personalize-the-user-interface-$-.md)|
