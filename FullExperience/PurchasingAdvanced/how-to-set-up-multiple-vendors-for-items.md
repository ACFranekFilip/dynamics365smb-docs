# How to: Set Up Multiple Vendors for Items
If you purchase the same item from more than one vendor, you must enter information about each vendor of the item, such as prices, lead time, discounts, and so on.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  You must have already set up cards for the relevant items and cards for the relevant vendors.  
  
### To set up multiple vendors for an item  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the relevant item, and then, on the **Home** tab, in the **Manage** group, choose **Edit**.  
  
3.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Purchases** group, choose **Vendors**.  
  
4.  Choose the **Vendor No.** field, and then select the vendor that you want to set up for the item.  
  
5.  Optionally, fill in the remaining fields.
