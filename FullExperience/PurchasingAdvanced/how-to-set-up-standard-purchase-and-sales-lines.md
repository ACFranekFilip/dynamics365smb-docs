# How to: Set Up Standard Purchase and Sales Lines
If you often need to create purchase and sales lines with similar information, you can set up standard lines, which you assign to vendors and customers. Then you can use the standard lines to insert recurring purchase lines and sales lines on documents for the vendors or customers.  
  
 The following procedure shows how to set up standard purchase lines. It works in a similar way for standard sales lines.  
  
### To set up standard purchase lines  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Standard Purchase Lines**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  On the **Home** tab, in the **New** group, choose **New**.  
  
3.  On the **General** FastTab, fill the fields to identify the standard lines  
  
4.  On the **Lines** FastTab, enter information in the fields to prepare purchase lines that reflect the standard lines that you expect to use as recurring lines on purchase documents.  
  
 Now you can assign the standard purchase lines to one or more vendors. For more information, see [How to: Assign Standard Purchase and Sales Lines to Vendors and Customers](../Purchasing/how-to-assign-standard-purchase-and-sales-lines-to-vendors-and-customers.md).
