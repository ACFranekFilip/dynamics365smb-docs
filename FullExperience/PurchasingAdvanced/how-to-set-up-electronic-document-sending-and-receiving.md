# How to: Set Up Alternative Vendor Addresses
You can associate any number of order addresses with a vendor. Each address is identified by a unique code, and when you use this code on a purchase quote, order, or invoice header, the related address information is printed on the purchase order.  
  
### To set up alternative order addresses for vendors  
  
1.  On the **Home** tab, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the relevant vendor, and then, on the **Home** tab, in the **Manage** group, choose **Edit**.  
  
3.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Vendor** group, choose **Order Addresses**.  
  
4.  Enter the order address code and related information.
