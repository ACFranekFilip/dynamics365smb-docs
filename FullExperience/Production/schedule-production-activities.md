# Schedule Production Activities
Before starting actual production activities, it is often necessary to fine schedule the rough\-cut production schedule that resulted from [Operations Planning](../OperationsPlanning/operations-planning.md). The main part of this work is to fit planned operations into the larger matrix of planned and started operations on multiple production resources along a time line. As a part of constantly maintaining a balanced production schedule, the work may also involve finding ways to better utilize resources to adjust for unforeseen changes in capacity.  
  
 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them. These tasks are listed in the order in which they are generally performed.
