# Communicate Production Plans
When a supply plan is established through master planning and material requirements planning, it must be communicated to the respective [Purchasing](../Purchasing/purchasing.md) and [production](../Production/production.md) departments. This step consists mainly of initiating the planned supply orders, typically by auto\-creating them with a function in the planning tools.  
  
 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them. These tasks are listed in the order in which they are generally performed.
