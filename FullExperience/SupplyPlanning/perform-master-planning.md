# Perform Master Planning
Before a detailed executable plan \( [see MRP](../OperationsPlanning/perform-material-requirements-planning.md)\) is in place, a number of initial, high\-level information must be established through master planning. Master planning considers all independent demand, including forecasts. Master planning also considers [resource availability](../OperationsPlanning/plan-for-resource-availability.md) and the final\-assembly production schedule, that is expected production orders for demanded end items.  
  
 In [!INCLUDE[navnow](../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)], the Calculate MPS option \(Master Production Schedule\) is the system expression of the above master planning activities.  
  
 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them. These tasks are listed in the order in which they are generally performed.
