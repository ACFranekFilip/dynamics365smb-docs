# How to: Receive Transfer Orders
When you have received a transfer order, you can post the receipt.  
  
### To receive a transfer order  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Transfer Order**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Find the transfer order that corresponds to the received items.  
  
3.  If the **Status** field on the transfer order header contains **Released**, go to the next step. If the **Status** field contains **Open**, on the **Actions** tab, in the **Release** group, choose **Release.**  
  
4.  On the **Actions** tab, in the **Posting** group, choose **Post**. If you also want to print the transfer order, choose **Post and Print** instead.  
  
5.  Select **Receive** in the message box, and choose the **OK** button.
