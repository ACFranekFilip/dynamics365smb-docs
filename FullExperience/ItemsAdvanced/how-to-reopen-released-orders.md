# How to: Reopen Released Orders
You can make changes to a released sales, purchase, transfer, or service order by reopening it.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  On document lines that have already been handled in the warehouse, the only change you can make is to change the quantity.  
  
### To reopen a released order  
  
1.  Open the relevant order.  
  
2.  On the **Actions** tab, in the **Release** group, choose **Reopen**. The **Status** field has now changed from **Released** to **Open**.  
  
 You can now make changes to the order before you release it again.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  When you have made your changes and you release the order, the VAT and the invoice discount are recalculated.  
>   
>  If you make changes to a released order, you must notify the warehouse about the changes.
