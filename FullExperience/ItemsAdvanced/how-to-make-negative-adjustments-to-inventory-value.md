# How to: Make Negative Adjustments to Inventory Value
Sometimes, you must make a negative adjustment to the value, but not the quantity, of one or more items.  
  
### To make negative adjustments to inventory value  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Item Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Fill in the first journal line by decreasing the quantity on inventory with a negative adjustment. Use a unit cost that corresponds to the actual posted cost.  
  
3.  Make a positive adjustment of the same quantity, setting the unit cost at the new, correct value.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  You can find the actual cost on a ledger entry list for an item. If you set the filter **Open** \= **Yes**, only the entries that are used to calculate the inventory value are shown. You can also see the cost in the **Inventory Valuation** report.
