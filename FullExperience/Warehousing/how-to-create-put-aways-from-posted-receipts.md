# How to: Create Put-aways from Posted Receipts
If your location uses both put\-away processing and receive processing and you have deleted put\-away lines, or if you use directed put\-away and pick and have decided not to use the put\-away worksheet, you can create or recreate put\-away instructions for posted receipt lines as follows.  
  
### To create a put\-away from a posted receipt  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Posted Whse. Receipts**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select a posted receipt that might need to be put away.  
  
3.  On the **Navigation** tab, in the **Line** group, choose **Card**.  
  
     If the **Document Status** field is blank, the receipt has not been put away at all. Otherwise, the field indicates the receipt is partially put\-away or completely put\-away.  
  
4.  If the receipt is partially put away or not put away at all, on the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Create Put\-away**.  
  
5.  Fill in the batch job request window to create the put\-away, and then choose the **OK** button.
