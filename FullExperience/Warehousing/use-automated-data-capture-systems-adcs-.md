# Use Automated Data Capture Systems (ADCS)
You can use your automatic data capture system \(ADCS\) to register the movement of items in the warehouse and to register some journal activities, such as quantity adjustments in the warehouse item journal and physical inventories.  
  
 To use ADCS, you must give each item stored in the warehouse an item identifier. You must also set up miniforms, handheld functions, data exchanges, and specify settings for fields that control ADCS. You specify whether to use ADCS on the location card of a warehouse. You set up miniform functionality in the administration of [!INCLUDE[navnow](../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)].  
  
 Based on the needs of your warehouse, you define the amount of information displayed in the miniform setup for the particular handheld device. The following are examples of information that you can display:  
  
-   Data from tables within [!INCLUDE[navnow](../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)], such as a list of pick documents from which the user can select.  
  
-   Text information.  
  
-   Messages to show confirmations or errors about activities performed and registered by the handheld device user.
