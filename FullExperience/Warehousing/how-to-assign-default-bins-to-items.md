# How to: Assign Default Bins to Items
If you are using bins at a location, assigning default bins to your items can make the process of shipping, receiving, and moving your items much easier. When a default bin is assigned to an item, this bin is suggested every time you initiate a transaction for this item. Default bins are defined in the **Bin Content** window.  
  
### To assign a default bin  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Bin Content Creation Worksheet**, and choose the related link.  
  
2.  Fill in the bin code and item information for each bin that you would like to set up as a default for an item. Make sure to select the **Default** field.  
  
3.  When you are finished, on the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Create Bin Content**. Default bins are now assigned for your items.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  When an item is put away, if the item does not have a default bin assigned, the bin where the item is put away is assigned as the default.
