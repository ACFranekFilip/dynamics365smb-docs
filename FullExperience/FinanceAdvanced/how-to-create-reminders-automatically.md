# How to: Create Reminders Automatically
A reminder is similar to an invoice. When you create a reminder, a reminder header, as well as one or more reminder lines, must be filled in. You can manually fill in a header and have the lines filled in for you, or you can create reminders for all customers automatically.  
  
### To create a reminder automatically  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Reminders**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **Reminder** window, on the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Create Reminders**. The **Create Reminders** batch job request page opens.  
  
3.  Set a filter on the **Customer** and\/or the **Cust. Ledger Entry** FastTab if you want to create reminders for selected customers and\/or for specific entries.  
  
4.  On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields with the relevant information.  
  
5.  Choose the **OK** button to start the batch job.
