# How to: Block Payment Tolerances for a Customer or a Vendor
The default setting for payment tolerance is allowed. To disallow a certain customer or vendor payment tolerance you need to block tolerance on the respective customer or vendor card.  
  
### To block payment tolerance for customers  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Customer** or **Vendor**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  On the **Payments** FastTab, select the **Block Payment Tolerance** check box.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If the customer or vendor has open entries, you must remove payment tolerance from entries that are currently open.
