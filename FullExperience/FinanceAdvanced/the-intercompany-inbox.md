# The Intercompany Inbox
All of the intercompany transactions that you receive electronically from your IC partners are listed in the IC Inbox.  
  
## Organizing the Inbox  
 You can use the filter fields at the top of the inbox window to determine which transactions are shown in the window. For example, if you only want to look at transactions a particular partner created, you can enter filters in the **Transaction Source** and **IC Partner Code** filters.  
  
### Transaction Source  
 What you can do with a transaction depends whether it was:  
  
-   Created by your IC partner  
  
-   Rejected by your IC partner and returned to you  
  
 You can use the **Show Transaction Source** field to filter the **IC Inbox Transactions** window so that it displays only one of these types of transactions. \(You can also filter by IC partner, or by the contents of the **Line Action** field.\)  
  
#### Created by IC Partner  
 When you receive a new transaction that was created by your partner, you can choose to:  
  
 Accept the transaction  
  
 Reject the transaction \(Return to partner\)  
  
 Cancel the transaction \(Delete the transaction but do not return it to your partner\)  
  
#### Returned from IC Partner  
 If the transaction was rejected by your IC partner, your only choice is to cancel the transaction in the inbox. Then you must create correction lines or reverse the journal or document in your company.  
  
## Re\-creating Inbox Entries  
 If you accepted a transaction in your inbox but then deleted the document or journal instead of posting it, you can re\-create the inbox entry and accept it again.  
  
## Getting an Overview of Intercompany Transactions for a Period  
 You can get an overview of all of the intercompany transactions that you have sent and received in a period. The **IC Transactions** report lists all intercompany G\/L entries, customer ledger entries, and vendor ledger entries.
