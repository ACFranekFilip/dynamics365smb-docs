# How to: Define Intercompany Dimensions
In order for a group of companies to use dimensions on intercompany transactions, they must agree on a set of dimensions to use as a common reference. Follow the steps in the procedure to define the IC dimensions that you and your partner companies will use to make intercompany transactions.  
  
### To define the IC dimensions  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **IC Dimensions**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **IC Dimensions** window, enter each dimension on a line in the window. If your IC dimensions will be similar or identical to your company dimensions, you can fill in the window automatically by using the **Copy from Dimensions** function, and then you can edit the resulting lines.  
  
3.  You can export the IC dimensions to an XML file for distribution to your partner companies. On the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Export**.  
  
4.  Specify the file name and the location where you want to save the XML file and then choose the **Save** button.  
  
 Before you can use the intercompany dimensions, you may want to map intercompany dimensions to your company's dimensions.
