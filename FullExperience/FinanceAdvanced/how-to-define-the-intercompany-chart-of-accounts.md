# How to: Define the Intercompany Chart of Accounts
In order for a group of companies to make intercompany transactions, they must agree on a chart of accounts to use as a common reference. To define the intercompany chart of accounts that your partner companies will use to make intercompany transactions, follow this procedure.  
  
### To define the intercompany chart of accounts  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **IC Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **IC Chart of Accounts** window, enter each account on a line in the window.  
  
3.  If your IC chart of accounts will be identical or similar to your regular chart of accounts, you can fill in the window automatically. On the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Copy from Chart of Accounts** to copy chart of accounts, and then you can edit the resulting lines.  
  
4.  You can export the intercompany chart of accounts to an XML file for distribution to your partner companies. On the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Export**.  
  
5.  Specify the file name and the location where you want to save the XML file and then choose the **Save** button.  
  
 Before you can use the intercompany chart of accounts, you may want to map the intercompany chart of accounts to your company's chart of accounts.
