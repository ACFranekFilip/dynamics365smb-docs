# How to: Set Up Responsibility Centers
In [!INCLUDE[navnow](../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)], you can set up responsibility centers to help administer your business.  
  
 A responsibility center can be a cost center, a profit center or an investment center. Examples of responsibility centers are a sales office, a purchasing department for several locations, and a plant planning office.  
  
 A responsibility center can administer sales and purchases for one or more warehouses or distribution centers, where goods are handled and stored prior to use.  
  
### To set up responsibility centers  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Responsibility Centers**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  On the **Home** tab, choose **New** to create a new responsibility center. Fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE[bp_fieldhelp]()]  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If you are using responsibility centers to administer your company, it can be useful to have a default responsibility center for your company. You assign it in the ![Shortcut icon](../BusinessFunctionality/OnlineMaps/media/shortcutcoldicon.gif "shortcutColdIcon")**[Company Information](DynamicsNAV:////runpage?Page=1)** window, on the **Shipping** FastTab, in the **Responsibility Center** field. The responsibility center assigned to the company will be used on all purchase and sales documents, if the user, customer, or vendor have no default responsibility center.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  When you enter a responsibility center code on a document, it affects the address, dimensions, and prices on the document.
