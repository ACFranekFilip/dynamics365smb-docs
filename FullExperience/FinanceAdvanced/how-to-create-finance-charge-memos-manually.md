# How to: Create Finance Charge Memos Manually
A finance charge memo is similar to an invoice.  
  
 You can fill in a header manually and have the lines filled in for you, or you can create finance charge memos for all customers automatically.  
  
### To create a finance charge memo manually  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Finance Charge Memos**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  On the **Home** tab, in the **New** group, choose **New**. Create a new finance charge memo.  
  
3.  On the **General** FastTab, fill in the **No.** field. You can press the Enter key to select the next available number.  
  
4.  In the **Customer No.** field, enter the number of the customer for which you want to create a finance charge memo.  
  
     On the **Posting** FastTab, the **Fin. Charge Terms Code** and the **Currency Code** fields are filled in with the corresponding code from the customer card.  
  
5.  On the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Suggest Fin. Charge Memo Lines**. The batch job request page opens.  
  
6.  Set a filter on the **Cust. Ledger Entry** FastTab if you want to create finance charge memos only for specific entries.  
  
7.  Choose the **OK** button to start the batch job.
