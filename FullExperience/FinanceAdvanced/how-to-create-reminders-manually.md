# How to: Create Reminders Manually
A reminder is similar to an invoice. When you create a reminder or reminder lines, you must fill the **General** FastTab in the **\($ N\_434 Reminder $\)** window. You can fill the FastTab manually and have the lines filled automatically, or you can create reminders for all customers automatically. For more information, see [How to: Create Reminders Automatically](../Finance/how-to-create-reminders-automatically.md).  
  
### To create a reminder manually  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Reminders**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  On the **Home** tab, in the **New** group, choose **New**.  
  
3.  On the **General** FastTab, fill in the **No.** field. You can press the Enter key to insert the next available number automatically.  
  
4.  In the **Customer No.** field, enter the number of the customer for which you want to create a reminder.  
  
5.  On the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Suggest Reminder Lines**. The **Suggest Reminder Lines** batch job request page opens.  
  
6.  Set a filter on the **Cust. Ledger Entry** FastTab if you want to create reminders for specific entries.  
  
7.  On the **Options** FastTab, select the **Only Entries with Overdue Amounts** check box if you want the reminders to contain only entries with overdue amounts. Otherwise, the reminder will contain all open entries for the customer.  
  
8.  On the **Options** FastTab, select the **Include Entries On Hold** check box if you want the reminders to contain overdue open entries that are on hold.  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  Open entries that are on hold will be inserted, irrespective of the setting in the **Only Entries with Overdue Amounts** check box.  
  
9. Choose the **OK** button to start the batch job.
