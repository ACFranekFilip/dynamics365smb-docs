# How to: Enter VAT-liable Amounts Without VAT in General Journals
When you enter a VAT\-liable amount including VAT on a journal line, you must enter it in the **Amount** field. Alternatively, you may enter the amount excluding VAT, also called the *VAT base*. If you choose to do so, you must not enter anything in the **Amount** field.  
  
### To enter VAT\-liable amounts without VAT  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **\($ N\_39 General Journal $\)**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Fill in the fields on the first line.  
  
3.  Enter the amount excluding VAT in the **VAT Base Amount** field or in the **Bal. VAT Base Amount** field.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The base amount fields are not included in the standard layout, but they can be inserted by your system administrator.  
  
 The **Gen. Posting Type**, **Gen. Bus. Posting Group**, and **Gen. Prod. Posting Group** fields and the corresponding fields for the balancing account are filled in automatically, but they can be changed if necessary.
