# How to: Prepare VAT Rate Change Conversions
Before you set up the VAT rate change tool, you must make the following preparations.  
  
### To prepare VAT rate change conversions  
  
1.  If you have transactions that use different rates, then they must be separated into different groups either by creating new general ledger accounts for each rate or by using data filters to group transactions according to rate.  
  
2.  If you create new general ledger accounts, then you must create new general posting groups.  
  
3.  To reduce the number of documents that get converted, post as many documents as possible and reduce unposted documents to a minimum.  
  
4.  Back up data.
