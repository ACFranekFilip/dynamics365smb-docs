# How to: Check Source Entries for Average Cost
If you want to find out why a particular item has a particular average cost, you can review the posted entries that have created this average cost. The average cost is calculated as the sum of Cost Amount \(Actual\) divided by the sum of Invoiced Quantity.  
  
### To check source entries for average cost  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Open the relevant item card.  
  
3.  In the **Invoicing** FastTab, select the **Unit Cost** field. The **Average Cost Calc. Overview** window opens.  
  
     In this window, you can review the sources of the average cost calculation.
