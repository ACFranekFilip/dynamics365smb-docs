# How to: View Reminder and Finance Charge Entries
When you issue a reminder, a reminder entry is created in the **Reminder\/Fin. Charge Entry** table for each reminder line that contains a customer ledger entry.  
  
 You can get an overview of the created reminder entries for a specific customer.  
  
### To view reminder and finance charge entries  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Open the relevant customer card.  
  
3.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **History** group, choose **Ledger Entries**. The **Customer Ledger Entries** window opens.  
  
4.  Select the line with the ledger entry you want to see the reminder entries for. On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Entry** group, choose **Reminder\/Fin. Charge Entries**.
