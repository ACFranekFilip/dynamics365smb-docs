# How to: Set Up Intercompany Postings
The Intercompany Postings functionality lets you save time and errors on data entry, by electronically transferring transactions between your company and your partner companies.  
  
### To set up intercompany postings  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Company Information**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **Company Information** window, on the **Communication** FastTab, fill in the **IC Partner Code**, **IC Inbox Type** and **IC Inbox Details** fields. For Help about a specific field, choose the field and press F1.  
  
3.  Open the **IC Partner List** to create and fill in a card for each of your partners.  
  
4.  If you have set up your intercompany partners as customers and vendors, fill in the **IC Partner Code** field on the relevant customer and vendor cards.  
  
5.  Set up the intercompany chart of accounts.  
  
6.  If you want to use dimensions on intercompany transactions, set up intercompany dimensions.  
  
7.  If you create or receive intercompany lines with items, you can either use your own item numbers, or set up your partner's item numbers for each relevant item. You can do this either in the **Vendor Item No.** field or the **Common Item No.** field on the item card, or use the **Item Cross Reference Entries** window that is linked to the item card.  
  
8.  If you will make intercompany transactions that include resources, you must fill in the **IC Partner Purch. G\/L Acc. No.** field on the resource card for each relevant resource.  
  
 Now you can create intercompany transactions using the intercompany general journal or sales or purchase documents.
