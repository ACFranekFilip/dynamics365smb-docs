# How to: Settle Purchase Invoices Promptly
If you need to pay the vendor by cash or check, you can have the necessary posting done at the same time that you post the invoice itself.  
  
### To settle purchase invoices promptly  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  On the **Home** tab, in the **New** group, choose **New**.  
  
3.  To pay either in cash or by bank transfer, enter the number of the general ledger cash account or the bank account in the **\($ T\_38\_55 Bal. Account No. $\)** field.  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  The **\($ T\_38\_94 Bal. Account Type $\)** and **\($ T\_38\_55 Bal. Account No. $\)** fields are not included in the standard layout of the invoice header. In order to post the payment of an invoice, you must first insert them with the design facilities.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If you frequently pay purchase invoices in cash, it is a good idea to set up a specific payment method with a balancing account and enter this method in the **Payment Method** field on the vendor card. The balancing account number is inserted automatically on the invoice header every time you create a new invoice.
