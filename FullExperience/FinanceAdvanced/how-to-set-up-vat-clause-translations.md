# How to: Set Up VAT Clause Translations
You can use translated VAT clauses for customers who have a language code that is specified on the customer card. Then, when you create and print for a customer a sales document that contains a VAT identifier, the printed document will include the VAT clause in translated text. The translated text will be based on the language code of the customer.  
  
### To set up the translation of a VAT clause  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **VAT Clauses**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **VAT Clauses** window, select a VAT clause from the list.  
  
3.  On the **General** tab, choose **Translation**.  
  
4.  In the **VAT Clause Translations** window, in the **Language Code** field, choose a language.  
  
5.  In the **Description** and **Description 2** fields, enter the text that is a translation of the descriptions. This text is displayed in translated VAT report documents.
