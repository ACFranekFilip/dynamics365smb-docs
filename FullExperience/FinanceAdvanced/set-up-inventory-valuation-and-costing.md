|Ensure that the cost is automatically posted to the general ledger whenever an inventory transaction is posted.|[Automatic Cost Posting](../Topic/\($%20T_313_2%20Automatic%20Cost%20Posting%20$\).md)|  
|Ensure that expected costs are posted to the general ledger to see from the interim G\/L accounts an estimate of the amounts due and the cost of the traded items before they are actually invoiced.|[Expected Cost Posting to G\-L](../Topic/\($%20T_313_5800%20Expected%20Cost%20Posting%20to%20G-L%20$\).md)|  
|Set the system up to adjust for any cost changes automatically every time you post inventory transactions.|[Automatic Cost Adjustment](../Topic/\($%20T_313_30%20Automatic%20Cost%20Adjustment%20$\).md)|

|Define inventory periods to control inventory value over time by disallowing transaction posting in closed inventory periods.|"Creating Inventory Periods" in [Working with Inventory Periods](../Finance/how-to-work-with-inventory-periods.md)|  
|Ensure that sales returns are applied to the original transaction to preserve inventory value \(works the same way for purchase returns\).|[Exact Cost Reversing Mandatory](../Topic/\($%20T_312_6602%20Exact%20Cost%20Reversing%20Mandatory%20$\).md)|  
|Predefine item charge types that you allow to be posted in relation to orders and thereby add to the unit cost of the traded items.|[Item Charge](../Topic/\($%20T_5800%20Item%20Charge%20$\).md)|  
|Ensure that value entries posted with the item journal are not duplicated by value entries posted with the regular Post Cost to G\/L Batch Job.|[How to: Post Purchases and Inventory Adjustments](../Finance/how-to-post-purchases-and-inventory-adjustments.md)|  
|Set up the rounding rules to apply when adjusting or suggesting item prices and when adjusting or suggesting standard costs.|[Rounding Method](../Topic/\($%20T_42%20Rounding%20Method%20$\).md)|
