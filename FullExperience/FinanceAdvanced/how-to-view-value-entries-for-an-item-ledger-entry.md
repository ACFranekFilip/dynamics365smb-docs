# How to: View Value Entries for an Item Ledger Entry
From the **Item Ledger Entries** window, you can access the value entries that relate to a specific item ledger entry.  
  
### To view value entries for an item ledger entry  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the item whose value entries you want to see.  
  
3.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **History** group, choose the **Entries** button, and then choose **Ledger Entries** to see a list of item ledger entries.  
  
4.  In the **\($ N\_38 Item Ledger Entries $\)** window, select the item ledger entry that you want to know more about.  
  
5.  On the **Home** tab, in the **Entry**  group, choose **Value Entries**. The **Value Entries** window opens showing one or more value entries for the selected item ledger entry.  
  
 You can also see all value entries for an item by selecting the item in the **Items** window, and then, on the **Navigate** tab, in the **History** group, choose **Value Entries**.  
  
 The calculation of inventory valuation uses the **\($ T\_5802\_43 Cost Amount \(Actual\) $\)** field in the **\($ N\_5802 Value Entries $\)** window of the value entries for the item. For more information, see [Design Details: Inventory Valuation](../ApplicationDesign/design-details-inventory-valuation.md).
