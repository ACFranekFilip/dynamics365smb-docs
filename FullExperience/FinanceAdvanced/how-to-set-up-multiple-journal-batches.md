# How to: Set Up Multiple Journal Batches
If you need multiple journals of a certain type, you can create multiple journal batches for a journal template.  
  
### To set up multiple journal batches  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **General Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **General Journal Templates** window, select the line that contains the template for which you want to set up batches.  
  
3.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Template** group, choose **Batches**.  
  
4.  Fill in the first empty line to create a new journal batch. Fill in the **Name** and **Description** fields and other fields if they are required.  
  
5.  Close the window.  
  
> [!TIP]  
>  Numbers have a special function in journal names. If a journal template name or journal batch name contains a number, the number automatically advances by one every time that the journal is posted. For example, if **HH1** is entered in the **Name** field, the journal name will change to **HH2** after the journal named **HH1** has been posted.
