# Set Up Currency Application Rules
You can allow transactions in different currencies to be applied to one another, for example, if you record a purchase order in one currency and then make the corresponding payment in a different currency. You can:  
  
-   Allow all currencies to be applied to one another,  
  
-   Prohibit applying any currencies to one another, or  
  
-   Specify a group of Economic and Monetary Union \(EMU\) currencies that can be applied to one another.  
  
 When you apply entries in different currencies to each other, there may be a difference between the two amounts when they are converted to LCY. You can specify how large of a difference you will allow, so that the entries can be closed. The difference will then be posted as a rounding difference.  
  
 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them. These tasks are listed in the order in which they are generally performed.
