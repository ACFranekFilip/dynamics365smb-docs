# How to: Reorganize Intrastat Journals
You must submit an Intrastat report every month and create a new journal batch for each report. So eventually, there will be many journal batches. The journal lines are not deleted automatically.  
  
 You may want to reorganize the journal batch names periodically. You do this by deleting the journal batches that you no longer need. The journal lines in these batches are also deleted.  
  
### To reorganize intrastat journals  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Intrastat Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **\($ N\_311 Intrastat Journal $\)** window, to view the options, choose the **Batch Name** field.  
  
3.  Select the journal batches to be deleted.  
  
4.  On **Home** Tab, choose **Delete** or press Ctrl\+D. Choose the **Yes** button.
