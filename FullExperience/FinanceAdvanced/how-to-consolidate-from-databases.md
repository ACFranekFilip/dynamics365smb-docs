2.  In the **Search** box, enter **Business Units**, and then choose the related link.  
  
3.  In the **\($ N\_240 Business Units $\)** window, on the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Import Database**.  
  
4.  On the **Business Unit** FastTab, you can set a filter in the **Code** field to select the business units that will be consolidated.  
  
5.  On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the appropriate fields. For Help about a specific field, choose the field and press F1.  
  
6.  In the **Copy Dimensions** field, choose the field to select the dimension codes.
