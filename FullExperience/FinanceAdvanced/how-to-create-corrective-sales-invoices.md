# How to: Create Corrective Sales Invoices
If you have posted a sales return order as received, but the item is subsequently rejected, you must invoice the sales return order so as to complete the transaction. A  posted sales credit memo is created in the process. Then you can issue a corrective sales invoice to re\-invoice your customer.  
  
 At this point, you have posted the sales return order as received and invoiced.  
  
### To create a corrective sales invoice  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  On the **Home** tab, in the **New** group, choose **New**. Create a sales invoice for the customer.  
  
3.  On the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Copy Document** to copy the lines from the incorrectly posted sales credit memo. For more information, see [Copy Sales Document](../Sales/-$-b_292-copy-sales-document-$-.md).
