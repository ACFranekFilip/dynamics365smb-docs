# Prepare Pre-Closing Reports
There are many standard reports that you can use to verify the accuracy of the accounts before closing the books at the end of a year or period. For example, you can use the **Customer \- Trial Balance** report to verify that the balance for a customer posting group is equal to the balance on the corresponding general ledger account on a certain date.  
  
 The following table describes a number of reports that may be useful in this process, with links to the topics that describe them.
