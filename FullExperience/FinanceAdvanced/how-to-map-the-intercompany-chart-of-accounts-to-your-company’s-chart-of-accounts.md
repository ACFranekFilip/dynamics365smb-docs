# How to: Map the Intercompany Chart of Accounts to Your Company’s Chart of Accounts
After you fill in the **IC Chart of Accounts** window with the chart of accounts that you and your intercompany partners have agreed to use, you need to associate each of the intercompany general ledger accounts with one of your company's general ledger accounts. In the **IC Chart of Accounts** window, you specify how intercompany general ledger accounts on incoming transactions will be translated into accounts from your company's chart of accounts.  
  
 When you create an intercompany sales or purchase line to send as an outgoing transaction, you will enter an account from the intercompany chart of accounts as a default for which account in your partner's company the amount should be posted to.  
  
 If the accounts in the intercompany chart of accounts have the same account numbers as the corresponding accounts in chart of accounts, you can map the accounts.  
  
### To map the intercompany chart of accounts to your company's chart of accounts  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **IC Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the lines that you want to map automatically. On the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Map to Acc. with Same No**.  
  
     For each intercompany general ledger account that was not mapped automatically.  
  
3.  Fill in the **Map\-to G\/L Acc. No.** field.  
  
     Now you can set up default IC partner general ledger accounts.
