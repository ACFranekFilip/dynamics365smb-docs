# How to: Re-create Intercompany Inbox and Outbox Transactions
Occasionally, you may want to re\-create a transaction in the inbox or outbox. For example, if you accepted a transaction in your inbox but then deleted the document or journal instead of posting it, you can re\-create the inbox entry and accept it again.  
  
 The following procedure describes to re\-create inbox transactions, but the same steps also apply to the outbox.  
  
### To re\-create intercompany inbox transactions  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Handled IC Inbox Transactions**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **\($ N\_617 Handled IC Inbox Transactions $\)** window, select the line with the transaction that you want to re\-create in the inbox.  
  
3.  On the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Re\-create Inbox Transaction**. Choose the **Yes** button.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[navnow](../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)] removes the line from the **\($ N\_617 Handled IC Inbox Transactions $\)** window and re\-creates it in the inbox.
