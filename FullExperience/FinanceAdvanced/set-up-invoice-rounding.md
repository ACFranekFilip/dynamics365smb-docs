# Set Up Invoice Rounding
It may be necessary to round invoice amounts when you create invoices. Local regulations or local custom may require the invoice to be rounded in a specific way, for example, to an amount divisible by 0.05.  
  
 The automatic invoice rounding function can handle these situations. When an invoice is rounded, an extra line is inserted with the rounding amount and this line is posted along with the other invoice lines.  
  
 To use automatic invoice rounding, you must:  
  
-   Specify the general ledger accounts to which rounding differences will be posted.  
  
-   Set up rules for rounding invoices in local currency and in foreign currency.  
  
-   Activate the function.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  In addition to the invoice rounding features, amounts on invoices can be rounded by the unit\-amount rounding feature and the amount rounding feature. For more information, see [Set Up Currencies](../Finance/set-up-currencies.md).
