# How to: Set Up User Defaults
You must set up a default set of templates and batches for each depreciation book. You can also specify a default for each user. The defaults are used when you enter a number in the **Insurance No.** field on a journal line and by the **Index Insurance** batch job.  
  
### To set up user defaults  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **FA Journal Setup**, and then choose the related link in **Financial Management**.  
  
2.  In the **Insurance Jnl. Template Name** field, choose the field to view the **Insurance Jnl Template List** window. Select one of the templates.  
  
3.  In the **Insurance Jnl. Batch Name** field, choose the field to view the **Insurance Journal Batches** window. Select one of the batches.  
  
4.  Choose the **Close** button to close the window.
