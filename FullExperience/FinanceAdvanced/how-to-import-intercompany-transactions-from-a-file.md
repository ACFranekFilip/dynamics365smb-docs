# How to: Import Intercompany Transactions from a File
If you have an intercompany partner that is not in the same database as your company, you can receive intercompany transactions from that partner in an .xml file. Then you must import the transactions into your inbox.  
  
### To import intercompany transactions from a file:  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Company Information** , and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Save the file to the location that you specified in the **\($ T\_79\_43 IC Inbox Details $\)** field in the **\($ N\_1 Company Information $\)** window.  
  
3.  In the **Search** box, enter **IC Inbox Transactions**, and then choose the related link.  
  
4.  In the **\($ N\_615 IC Inbox Transactions $\)** window, on the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Import Transaction File**.  
  
5.  In the window that appears, select the .xml file that contains the transactions and then choose the **Open** button.  
  
 The transactions are imported into the inbox and you can now process them.
