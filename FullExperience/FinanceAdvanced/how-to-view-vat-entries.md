# How to: View VAT Entries
Every posting that involves VAT creates an entry in the **VAT Entries** window. These entries are used to calculate your VAT settlement amount, such as your payment and refund, for a specific period.  
  
### To view VAT entries  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **G\/L Registers**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **\($ N\_116 G\/L Registers $\)** window, on the **Home** tab, in the **Process** group, choose **VAT Entries**.  
  
3.  Remove any filters.  
  
 The window now displays all the posted VAT entries.
