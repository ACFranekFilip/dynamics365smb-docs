# How to: Create New Inventory Analysis Reports
You use analysis reports to analyze the dynamics of your inventory according to key performance indicators that you select, for example inventory turnover. You can also use the report to analyze your inventory costs, in terms of direct and indirect costs, as well as the value and quantities of your different types of inventory.  
  
 Creating a report means defining a combination of analysis lines and analysis columns. For example, you might define a list of item groups and inventory turnover for the current year compared to last year. Before you create new reports, you must set up templates for the lines and columns . You can set up as many line and column templates as you like, and then combine them to create new analysis reports.  
  
### To create new inventory analysis reports  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Inventory Analysis Report**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **Analysis Report Name** field, open the **Analysis Report Names** window.  
  
3.  In the **Name** field, enter the name you want to give your new analysis report. In the **Description** field, enter a description.  
  
4.  In the **Analysis Line Template Name** field, open the **Inventory \- Analysis Line Templates** window, and select the relevant analysis line template. Choose the **OK** button to copy it to the field.  
  
5.  In the **Analysis Column Template Name** field, open the **Inventory \- Analysis Column Templates** window, and select the relevant analysis column template. Choose the **OK** button to copy it to the field.  
  
6.  Choose the **OK** button to view the report that you have created.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  You can build combinations of line and column templates to create reports and assign them unique names. If you do this, you can select a report name only in the **Inventory Analysis Report** window. You do not need to select line and column templates. After you have chosen a report name, you can change line and column templates independently, and then later select the report name again to restore the original combination.
