### To export a purchase analysis view to Excel

2.  Select the analysis view, and then, on the **Actions** tab, in the **General** group, choose **Edit Analysis View**.  
  
3.  In the **Analysis View List Purchase** window, on the **Actions** tab, in the **General** group, choose **Show Matrix**.
