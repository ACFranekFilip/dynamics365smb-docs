# How to: Update Purchase Analysis Views
The amounts that are displayed in the **Purchase Analysis by Dimensions** window give you a picture of the purchases at the time of the last update. To get a picture of the actual state, you must update the analysis view by choosing the **Update** button. You can do this in the following windows:  
  
-   In the **Purchase Analysis View Card** window.  
  
-   In the **Purchase Analysis View List** window.  
  
 The following procedure is for updating an analysis view from the **Purchase Analysis View List** window.  
  
### To update a purchase analysis view  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter  **Purchase Analysis by Dimensions**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the analysis view line that you want to update, and then, on the **Home** tab, in the **Process** group, choose **Update**.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If you select the **Update on Posting** field in an analysis view card, the card automatically updates when you post item ledger entries.
