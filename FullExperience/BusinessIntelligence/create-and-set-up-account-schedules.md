# Create and Set Up Account Schedules
Account schedules are used to arrange accounts listed in the chart of accounts in ways that will provide information about those accounts. You can set up various layouts to define the information that you want to extract from the chart of accounts. One of the main functions of account schedules is to provide a place for calculations that cannot be made directly in the chart of accounts, such as creating subtotals for groups of accounts, which can be included in new totals and can then be used in other totals. For example, users can create account schedules to calculate profit margins on such dimensions as departments or customer groups. In addition, general ledger entries and general ledger budget entries can be filtered, for example, by net change or debit amount.  
  
 You can also compare two or more account schedules and column layouts by using formulas. This kind of comparison provides the ability to:  
  
 • Create customized financial reports.  
  
 • Create as many account schedules as needed, each with a unique name.  
  
 • Set up various report layouts and print the reports with the current figures.
