# How to: View Actual and Budgeted Amounts for All Accounts
You can view general ledger budgets and compare them with actual figures in several areas of [!INCLUDE[navnow](../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)].  
  
### To view actual and budgeted amounts for all accounts  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **Chart of Accounts** window, on the **Navigate** tab, in the **Balance** group, choose **G\/L Balance\/Budget**.  
  
3.  Fill in the fields in the header. [!INCLUDE[bp_fieldhelp]()]  
  
4.  To see a specification that makes up the amount shown, choose the field.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The filters you set in the window header will be applied to general ledger entries and also budget entries.  
>   
>  The leftmost columns contain the chart of accounts. Of the five columns on the rightmost side, the first four columns show actual and budgeted debit and credit amounts for each account. The fifth column shows the proportional relationship between the actual and the budgeted amounts on the general ledger account.  
  
> [!TIP]  
>  Use the **View by** field in the **G\/L Balance\/Budget** window to select the period length. Use the **View as** field to select the way the amounts will be calculated, **Net Change** or **Balance at Date**. On the **Actions** tab, choose **Previous Period** or **Next Period** to change the period.
