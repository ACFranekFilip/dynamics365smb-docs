# How to: Update Sales Analysis Views
The amounts that are displayed in the **Sales Analysis by Dimensions** window gives you a picture of the sales and purchases at the time of the last update. To get a picture of the actual state, you must update the analysis view by choosing the **Update** button. You can do this in the following windows:  
  
-   In the **Sales Analysis View Card** window.  
  
-   In the **Sales Analysis View List** window.  
  
 The following procedure is for updating an analysis view from the **Sales Analysis View List** window.  
  
### To update a sales analysis view  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **\($ N\_7158 Sales Analysis by Dimensions $\)**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the analysis view line that you want to update, and then, on the **Home** tab, in the **Process** group, choose **Update**.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If you select the **Update on Posting** field in an analysis view card, the card automatically updates when you post item ledger entries.
