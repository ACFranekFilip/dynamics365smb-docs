# How to: Export Sales Analysis Views to Excel
You can export your sales analysis views to Microsoft Excel. In Excel, you can analyze and work with Product Name data using the full range of features in Excel.  
  
### To export sales analysis views to Excel  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Analysis Views**, and then choose the related link.  Select the relevant analysis view.  
  
2.  On the **Actions** tab, in the **General** group, choose **Edit Analysis View**. The **Analysis by Dimensions** window opens.  
  
3.  On the **Options** FastTab, in the **Show** field, you can select  **Actual Amounts**, **Budgeted Amounts**, or one of the options to compare actual amounts against budgeted amounts.  
  
4.  Fill in the rest of the fields on the FastTabs.  
  
5.  When you have finished filling in the fields, on the **Actions** tab, in the **General** group, choose **Show Matrix** to see the results.  
  
6.  On the **Home** tab, in the **Process** group, choose **Export to Excel**.  
  
> [!WARNING]  
>  The maximum possible number of lines in Excel is approximately 65000. If your analysis view generates too many lines, an error message will appear in Excel.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  In Excel, the column headings always display the dimension code. To display both codes and names in Excel, in the **Analysis by Dimensions** window, on the **Options** FastTab, select the **Show Column Name** field.
