# How to: Set Up Analysis Types
For each column, except for the column type **Formula**, that you set up in the **Analysis Columns** window, you must select an analysis type code to specify the value type of the item ledger entry and value entry to be copied to the **Analysis Report** window and printed reports.  
  
### To set up analysis types  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **\($ N\_7110 Analysis Types $\)**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **Code** field, enter a unique code that identifies the analysis type. In the **Name** field, enter a description of the analysis type.  
  
3.  In the **Value Type** field, select a value type that you want to base the analysis type on.  
  
4.  You must also fill in the **Item Ledger Entry Type Filter** and the **Value Entry Type Filter** fields.  
  
5.  To revert to default analysis types, on the **Actions** tab, in the **General** group, choose **Reset Default Analysis Types**.
