# How to: Set Up Sales Analysis Views
A sales analysis by dimensions displays a selected combination of dimensions. You can store and retrieve each analysis you have set up. The information for setting up an analysis is stored on a sales analysis view card to simplify future analysis.  
  
### To set up a sales analysis view  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Sales Analysis View Card**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  On the **Home** tab, in the **New** group, choose **New**. The **\($ N\_7155 Sales Analysis View Card $\)** window opens.  
  
3.  Fill in the fields to specify which customer or customers and location to analyze dimensions for.  
  
4.  To add other dimension codes in addition to the three on the **Dimensions** FastTab, on the **Navigate** tab, in the **Analysis** group, choose **Filter**.  
  
5.  In the **Sales Analysis View Filter** window, specify other dimension codes by which you want to analyze the customerâ€™s performance.  
  
6.  To update the view, in the **Sales Analysis View Card** window, on the **Home** tab, in the **Process** group, choose **Update**.  
  
 You can view the same sales performance indicators in a chart. For more information, see [\($ N\_770 Sales Performance $\)](../Topic/\($%20N_770%20Sales%20Performance%20$\).md).
