# How to: Create New Sales Analysis Reports
You use analysis reports to analyze the dynamics of your sales according to key sales performance indicators that you select, for example, sales turnover in both amounts and quantities, contribution margin, or progress of actual sales against the budget. You can also use the report to analyze your average sales prices and evaluate the sales performance of your sales force.  
  
 Creating a report means defining a combination of analysis lines, for example, a list of customer groups, and analysis columns, for example, gross profit for the current year compared to last year. Before you create new reports, you must set up templates for the lines and columns . You can set up as many line and column templates as you like, and then combine them to create new analysis reports. For more information, see [How to: Set Up Analysis Line Templates](../BusinessIntelligence/how-to-set-up-analysis-line-templates.md) and [How to: Set Up Analysis Column Templates](../BusinessIntelligence/how-to-set-up-analysis-column-templates.md).  
  
### To create a new sales analysis report  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Sales Analysis Reports**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **Analysis Report Sale** window, on the **Home** tab, in the **New** group, choose **New**.  
  
3.  Select the first empty line, and in the **Name** field, enter the name you want to give your new analysis report. In the **Description** field, enter a description.  
  
4.  Fill in the **Analysis Line Template Name** field and the **Analysis Column Template Name** field.  
  
5.  On the **Home** tab, in the **Process** group, choose **Edit Analysis Report**. The **Sales Analysis Report** window opens.  
  
6.  On the **Home** tab, in the **Process** group, choose **Show Matrix** to view the report that you have created.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Building combinations of line and column templates to create reports and assigning them unique names is optional. If you do this, selecting a report name means that you will not need to select line and column templates in the **Sales Analysis Report** window. After you have chosen a report name, you can change line and column templates independently and then later select the report name again to restore the original combination.
