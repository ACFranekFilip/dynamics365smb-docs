# How to: View Budgets
In a budget with dimensions, you can filter the entries and see specific budgets.  
  
### To view a budget  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **G\/L Budgets**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **\($ N\_121 G\/L Budgets $\)** window, open the budget that you want to view.  
  
3.  On each FastTab, fill in the relevant fields. On the **Filters** FastTab, fill in at least one filter field.  
  
4.  If you have selected **Period** in either the **Show as Lines** or **Show as Columns** field, then you must fill in the **View by** field on the **General** FastTab.  
  
5.  If you have not selected **Period** in either the **Show as Lines** or **Show as Columns** field, then enter the appropriate period on the **Filters** FastTab in the **Date Filter** field.  
  
6.  On the **Actions** tab, choose **Show Matrix** to view the budget matrix.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Only entries from the general ledger budget with the filter codes that you enter on the **Filters** FastTab are included in the calculation. Budget entries with other filter codes or without any filter codes are not included.  
>   
>  As long as the filter remains on the window, the budget only displays the budget entries with these filter codes.  
  
> [!TIP]  
>  If you want to modify the budget, you can modify the budget entries. Choose an amount to view the underlying general ledger budget entries.
