# How to: Set Up Inventory Analysis Views
An inventory analysis view displays a selected combination of dimensions for a specified item or items at a specified location. You can store and retrieve each analysis you have set up. The information for setting up an analysis view is stored in an analysis view card to simplify future analysis.  
  
### To set up an inventory analysis view  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Inventory Analysis View Card**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  On the **Home** tab, in the **New** group, choose **New**. The **Invt. Analysis View Card** window opens.  
  
3.  Fill in the fields to specify which item or items and location to analyze dimensions for.  
  
4.  To add other dimension codes in addition to the three on the **Dimensions** FastTab, on the **Navigate** tab, in the **Analysis** group, choose **Filter**.  
  
5.  In the **Item Analysis View Filter** window, specify other dimension codes by which you want to analyze the itemâ€™s performance.  
  
6.  To update the view, in the **Item Analysis View Card** window, on the **Home** tab, in the **Process** group, choose **Update**.  
  
 You can view the same item performance indicators in a chart. For more information, see [Inventory Performance](../Topic/\($%20N_772%20Inventory%20Performance%20$\).md).
