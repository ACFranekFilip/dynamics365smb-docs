# How to: View Inventory Analysis Information by Dimensions
In the **Invt. Analysis by Dimensions** matrix, you can look at the amounts in your general ledger using the analysis views you have already set up.  
  
### To view inventory analysis views by dimensions  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Inventory View by Dimensions**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the analysis view that you want. On the **Actions** tab, in the **General** group, choose **Edit Analysis View**. The **\($ N\_7159 Invt. Analysis by Dimensions $\)** window opens.  
  
3.  On each FastTab, fill in the fields.  
  
4.  On the **Actions** tab, in the **General** group, choose **Show Matrix** to display the matrix.  
  
5.  To see a specification of an amount shown in the matrix window, select the amount.  
  
 The columns in the matrix display the following information:  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|**Code**|This column shows the code given to a dimension value.|  
|**Name**|This column shows the name given to a dimension value.|  
|**Total Amount**|This column shows the total amount for the amount type that you select on the **Options** FastTab in the **Show** field.|  
|**Matrix**|Each column in the right side of the matrix shows amounts based on an analysis view.|  
  
-   The left columns contain information based on what you have selected in the **Show as Lines** field in the request window.  
  
-   The right columns contain information based on what you have selected in the **Show as Columns** field in the request window.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  You can use the **Dimensions \- Detail** report to display a detailed classification of how dimensions have been used on entries over a selected period. You can use the **Dimensions \- Total** report to display only the total amounts.  
  
> [!TIP]  
>  The **Option** FastTab gives you many different choices to view the amounts according to your needs.  
  
 You can also alter the view by changing the contents of the **Show as Lines** field and **Show as Columns** field. For example, you can use one analysis view with four dimensions to make 42 different analysis view breakdowns.  
  
 To reverse lines and columns, on the **Navigate** tab, in the **Actions** group, choose **Reverse Lines and Columns** in the request window.
