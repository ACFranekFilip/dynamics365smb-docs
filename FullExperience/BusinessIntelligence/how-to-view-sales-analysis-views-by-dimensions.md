# How to: View Sales Analysis Views by Dimensions
In the **Sales Analysis by Dimensions** matrix, you can look at the amounts in your general ledger using the analysis views you have already set up. You fill in the fields in the **Sales Analysis by Dimensions** dialog box and then choose **Show Matrix** to view the matrix with rows and columns. The left columns contain information based on what you have selected in the **Show as Lines** field in the dialog box. The right columns contain information based on what you have selected in the **Show as Columns** field.  
  
### To view sales analysis views by dimensions  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **\($ N\_7158 Sales Analysis by Dimensions $\)**, and then choose the related link. The **Analysis View List Sales** window opens.  
  
2.  Select the view that you want to analyze. On the **Home** tab, in the **Process** group, choose **Edit Analysis View**.  
  
3.  In the **\($ N\_7158 Sales Analysis by Dimensions $\)** window, fill in the fields to define the analysis view.  
  
    > [!TIP]  
    >  The **Options** FastTab gives you many different choices to view the amounts according to your needs.  
    >   
    >  You can also alter the view by changing the contents of the **Show as Lines** field and **Show as Columns** field. For example, you can use one analysis view with four dimensions to make 42 different analysis view breakdowns.  
  
4.  To reverse lines and columns, on the **Navigate** tab, in the **Actions** group, choose **Reverse Lines and Columns**.  
  
5.  On the **Actions** tab, in the **General** group, choose **Show Matrix** to open  the analysis view.  
  
6.  To see a specification of an amount shown in the matrix window, choose  the amount.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  You can use the **Dimensions \- Detail** report to display a detailed classification of how dimensions have been used on entries over a selected period. You can use the **Dimensions \- Total** report to display only the total amounts.
