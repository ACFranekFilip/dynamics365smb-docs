# How to: Set Up Account Schedule Columns Manually
After you have created a new account schedule and set up the rows in your account schedule, you must set up columns. You can either set them up manually or assign a predefined column layout to your account schedule. Otherwise, no information will display.  
  
### To set up account schedule columns manually  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Account Schedules**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **\($ N\_104 Account Schedule $\)** window, in the **Name** field, select the account schedule name, and then choose the **OK** button.  
  
3.  On the **Actions** tab, in the **General** group, choose **Edit Column Layout Setup**.  
  
4.  Fill in the fields in the **Column Layout** window. [!INCLUDE[bp_fieldhelp]()]  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  A printed version of an Account Schedule can display a maximum of five columns. If there are more than five columns in an Account Schedule, only the first five will be printed. The preview will show you exactly how the rows and columns will appear in the printed version.
