# How to: Update Analysis Views
The amounts that are displayed in the **Analysis by Dimensions** window give you a picture of the companyâ€™s state at the time of the last update. To get a picture of the current state, you must update the analysis view by running the update function. You can do this from the following locations:  
  
-   ![Shortcut icon](../BusinessFunctionality/OnlineMaps/media/shortcutcoldicon.gif "shortcutColdIcon")  **[Update Analysis Views](DynamicsNAV:////runreport?report=84)**  batch job  
  
-   ![Shortcut icon](../BusinessFunctionality/OnlineMaps/media/shortcutcoldicon.gif "shortcutColdIcon")  **[Analysis View Card](DynamicsNAV:////runpage?page=555)**  
  
-   ![Shortcut icon](../BusinessFunctionality/OnlineMaps/media/shortcutcoldicon.gif "shortcutColdIcon")  **[Analysis View List](DynamicsNAV:////runpage?page=556)**  
  
 The following procedure is for updating an analysis view from the **Analysis by Dimensions** window.  
  
### To update an analysis view  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Analysis by Dimensions**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **Analysis by Dimensions** window, to view the options, choose the **Analysis View Code** field.  
  
3.  Select the line with the relevant analysis view.  
  
4.  On the **Home** tab, in the **Process** group, choose **Update**.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  To update some or all analysis views at the same time, you must use the ![Shortcut icon](../BusinessFunctionality/OnlineMaps/media/shortcutcoldicon.gif "shortcutColdIcon")**[Update Analysis Views](DynamicsNAV:////runreport?report=84)** batch job.  
>   
>  If you select the **Update on Posting** check box in an analysis view card, [!INCLUDE[navnow](../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)] automatically updates when you post.
