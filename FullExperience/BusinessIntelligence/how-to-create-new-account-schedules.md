# How to: Create New Account Schedules
You use account schedules to analyze figures in general ledger accounts or to compare general ledger entries with general ledger budget entries. For example, you can view the general ledger entries as percentages of the budget entries.  
  
### To create new account schedules  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Account Schedules**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **\($ N\_103 Account Schedule Names $\)** window, on the **Home** tab, choose **New** to create a new account schedule name. In the **Name** field, enter the name that you want to give your new account schedule.  
  
3.  Fill in the **\($ T\_84\_3 Default Column Layout $\)** and **\($ T\_84\_4 Analysis View Name $\)** fields as appropriate.  
  
4.  On the **Home** tab, in the **Process** group, choose **Edit Account Schedule** to begin defining rows for the account schedule.  
  
 If you did not assign a default column layout to the account schedule, you must set up the columns manually.
