# How to: View Actual and Budgeted Amounts for Several Periods
Instead of viewing the actual and budgeted amounts for all accounts within a single period, you can view a number of periods for a single account.  
  
### To view actual and budgeted amounts for several periods  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **Chart of Accounts** window, select the relevant general ledger account.  
  
3.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Balance** group, choose **G\/L Account Balance\/Budget**.  
  
4.  Fill in the fields in the header. [!INCLUDE[bp_fieldhelp]()]  
  
5.  To see a specification of an amount shown, choose the field.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The filters you set in the window header will be applied to general ledger entries and also budget entries.  
>   
>  The leftmost columns contain the periods according to the selected time interval. There are five columns on the rightmost side. The first four columns show actual and budgeted debit and credit amounts for each account. The fifth column shows the proportional relationship between the actual and the budgeted amounts on the general ledger account.
