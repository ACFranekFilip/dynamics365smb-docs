# How to: Update Inventory Analysis Views
The amounts that are displayed in the **Invt. Analysis by Dimensions** window gives you a picture of the sales and purchases at the time of the last update. To get a picture of the actual state, you must update the item analysis view by choosing **Update**. You can do this in the following windows:  
  
-   In the **\($ N\_7150 Invt. Analysis View Card $\)** window.  
  
-   In the **\($ N\_7151 Analysis View List Inventory $\)** window.  
  
 The following procedure shows how to update an analysis view from the **\($ N\_7151 Analysis View List Inventory $\)** window.  
  
### To update an inventory analysis view  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Inventory Analysis by Dimensions**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **Analysis View List Inventory** window, select the analysis view that you want to update.  
  
3.  On the **Actions** tab, in the **General** group, choose **Update**.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If you select the **Update on Posting** field on an analysis view card, the  view updates whenever you post an item ledger entry.
