# How to: Set Up Analysis Line Templates
In an analysis report your analysis objects are shown on the lines. You can define the lines that you want to include in your analysis report by setting up analysis line templates.  
  
 A template contains a set of lines representing the analysis lines that you see in the analysis report. A line can specify one or a range of items, customers, vendors, or groups. You can also create a formula in a line to sum up the other lines. You can set up as many line templates as you like, and then use them to create new analysis reports.  
  
### To set up analysis line templates  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Analysis Line Template**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the first empty line, and in the **Name** field, enter the name you want to give your new analysis line template. In the **Description** field, enter a description.  
  
3.  On the **Home** tab, in the **Process** group, choose **Lines**.  
  
4.  In the **Analysis Lines** window, create lines for the items, customers, vendors, or salespeople you want to view figures for in your analysis report. You must fill in the **Type**, **Range**, and the **Description** fields.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  Alternatively, when you want to create many individual lines for each item, customer, and so on, you can select the appropriate insert option to fill in all the relevant fields on the line. If you need to, you can then edit the lines manually.  
    >   
    >  To insert lines, on the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Insert Items** or **Insert Item Groups**.
