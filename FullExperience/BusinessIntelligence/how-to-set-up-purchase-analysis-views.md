# How to: Set Up Purchase Analysis Views
An analysis by dimensions displays a selected combination of dimensions. You can store and retrieve each analysis you have set up. The information for setting up an analysis is stored on an analysis view card to simplify future analysis.  
  
### To set up a purchase analysis view  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Purchase Analysis View Card**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  On the **Home** tab, in the **New** group, choose **New**. The **Purchase Analysis View Card** window opens.  
  
3.  Fill in the fields to specify which customer or customers and location to analyze dimensions for.  
  
4.  To add other dimension codes in addition to the three on the **Dimensions** FastTab, on the **Navigate** tab, in the **Analysis** group, choose **Filter**.  
  
5.  In the **Purchase Analysis View Filter** window, specify other dimension codes by which you want to analyze the customerâ€™s performance.  
  
6.  To update the view, in the **Purchase Analysis View Card** window, on the **Home** tab, in the **Process** group, choose **Update**.  
  
 You can view the same purchase performance indicators in a chart. For more information, see [Purchase Performance](../Topic/\($%20N_771%20Purchase%20Performance%20$\).md).
