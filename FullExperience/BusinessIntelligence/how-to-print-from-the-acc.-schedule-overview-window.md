# How to: Print from the Acc. Schedule Overview Window
Sometimes you may set up an account schedule on screen in the **Acc. Schedule Overview** window, and then find out that you want to print out the account schedule that you have designed. Instead of opening the report request window from the report menu and filling in the information all over again, you can use the following shortcut.  
  
### To print from the acc. schedule overview window  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Account Schedules**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **Account Schedule Names** window, on the **Home** tab, in the **Process** group, choose **Overview**.  
  
3.  In the **Acc. Schedule Overview** window, on the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Print**.  
  
4.  Choose the **Print** button to print the report.
