# How to: Assign Predefined Column Layouts to Account Schedules
You can assign a predefined column layout to a particular account schedule as a default. Before you can do this, you must create a new account schedule and set up the rows in the account schedule.  
  
### To assign predefined column layouts to account schedules  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Account Schedules**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **Account Schedule Names** window, fill in the **Default Column Layout** field for the relevant account schedules.  
  
 The column layout will be used as the default layout on printed reports and in the **Acc. Schedule Overview** window.
