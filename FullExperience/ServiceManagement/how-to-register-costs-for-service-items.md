# How to: Register Costs for Service Items
When working on service items in service orders, you may need to register alternative cost for the service of specific service items. The following procedure shows how to register the cost in the **Service Item Worksheet** window.  
  
 If the service order requires a link between the service and service items, you can use the same procedure to register the cost in the **Service Lines** window, which you open by opening relevant service order first, and then choosing **Actions**![Action Menu icon](../DesignAndEngineering/media/actionmenuicon.png "actionMenuIcon"), choosing **Order**, and choosing **Service Lines**.  
  
### To register costs for service items  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Tasks**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the line that includes the relevant service item. On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Service Tasks** group, choose **Item Worksheet**.  
  
3.  Enter a new service line.  
  
4.  In the **Type** field, select **Cost**.  
  
5.  In the **No.** field, select the relevant cost.  
  
6.  In the **Quantity** field, enter the number of times you want to invoice the cost.  
  
 Repeat these steps for each service cost you want to register.
