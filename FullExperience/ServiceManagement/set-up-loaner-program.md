# Set Up Loaner Program
Sometimes you must provide a customer a loaner item for use when your customer service team makes a repair. Using [!INCLUDE[navnow](../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)], you can set up a loaner program, loan your customers items, and track the receipt of the items back.  
  
 In addition, you may choose to add notes about loaners, by using one of two ways to register comments:  
  
-   Enter a note or comment about the loaner itself.  
  
-   Enter a note on a service item about the need for a loaner.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  As for service items generally, loaner items are not part of inventory nor can they take part in any warehouse activities.  
  
 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them. These tasks are listed in the order in which they are generally performed.
