# How to: Register Fault Comments
You can use the **Fault Service Comment Sheet** window to register comments on the faults of service items in service orders and service quotes.  
  
 The following procedure uses a service order as an example, but the same procedure can apply to service quotes.  
  
### To register fault comments  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Open the relevant service order.  
  
3.  Select the line you want to register fault comments for. Choose **Actions** ![Action Menu icon](../DesignAndEngineering/media/actionmenuicon.png "actionMenuIcon"), choose **Line** , choose **Comments**, and then choose **Faults**. The **Fault Service Comment Sheet** window opens.  
  
4.  In the **Date** field, enter a date.  
  
5.  In the **Comment** field, enter a comment. You can enter a maximum of 80 characters. If you need to enter additional text, go to the next line. You can fill in as many lines as necessary.
