# Contract Gain-Loss (Reason Codes) Overview
The **Contract Gain\/Loss \(Reason Codes\)** matrix shows a scrollable summary of contract gain\/loss entries, based on reason codes.  
  
 You fill in the **Contract Gain\/Loss \(Reason Codes\)** window to determine what will be shown in the matrix.  
  
 You can specify the reason codes that are included in the matrix by setting filters in the **Reason Code Filter** field. If you do not set any filters, the matrix will include information about all reason codes.  
  
 In the **Period Start** field, you can specify the starting date of the period that you want to view.  
  
 You use the **View by** field to select the time interval.  
  
 You use the **View as** field to determine what type of amount will be shown in the period columns: **Net Change**, which displays the net change for each period or **Balance at Date**, which displays the value as of the last day in each period.  
  
 You choose **Show Matrix** to view the matrix. The first three columns contain the time intervals and the total gain\/loss amount for each interval, and the remaining columns contain the total gain\/loss amount for each reason code for the same time intervals.  
  
 When you scroll up and down, the amounts \(in LCY\) are calculated according to the time interval you have selected.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  If you have set the time interval to **Day** and you want to scroll over a long period, you can do it faster by shifting to a larger interval such as **Quarter**. When you have found the desired period, you can shift back to the original interval to see the data in more detail.
