# How to: Register Internal Comments
You can use the **Internal Service Comment Sheet** window to register internal comments on service items in service orders and service quotes. Internal comments are for internal use only and are not printed on reports.  
  
 The following procedure uses a service order as an example, but the same procedure can apply to service quotes.  
  
### To register internal comments  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Open the relevant service order.  
  
3.  Select the line you want to register internal comments for. Choose **Actions**![Action Menu icon](../DesignAndEngineering/media/actionmenuicon.png "actionMenuIcon"), choose **Line**, choose **Comments**, and then choose **Internal**. The **Internal Service Comment Sheet** window opens.  
  
4.  In the **Date** field, enter a date.  
  
5.  In the **Comment** field, enter a comment. You can enter a maximum of 80 characters, including spaces. If you need to enter additional text, go to the next line. You can fill in as many lines as necessary.
