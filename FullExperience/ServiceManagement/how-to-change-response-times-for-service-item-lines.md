# How to: Change Response Times for Service Item Lines
When you register a service item line in a service order or quote, the response time in hours is automatically entered and the response date and time are calculated accordingly. You can change the response time in hours and the response date and time if you need to.  
  
### To change the response time for a service item line  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Orders** or **Service Quotes**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the relevant service order or quote. On the **Home** tab, in the **Manage** group, choose **Service Order** or **Service Quote**. The window for that particular service order or service quote opens.  
  
3.  Select the service item line you want to change the response time for.  
  
4.  Either in the **Response Time \(Hours\)** field or in the **Response Date** and **Response Time** fields, enter the new response hours or response date and time.
