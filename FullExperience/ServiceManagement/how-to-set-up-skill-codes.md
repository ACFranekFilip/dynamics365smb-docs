# How to: Set Up Skill Codes
You can use the **Skill Codes** window to set up codes for skills that are required to repair and maintain service items. When you allocate resources, for example, technicians, to service items, you can select a resource that has the skills required to service the item.  
  
 You set up how you use skill codes in the **Resource Skills Option** field in the **Service Mgt. Setup** window.  
  
### To set up a skill code  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Skill Codes**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Create a new skill code.  
  
3.  Fill in the **Code** and **Description** fields.  
  
 Repeat these steps for each skill code that you want to create.
