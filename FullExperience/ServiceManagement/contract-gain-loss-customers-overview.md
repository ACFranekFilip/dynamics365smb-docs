# Contract Gain-Loss (Customers) Overview
The **Contract Gain\/Loss \(Customers\)** matrix shows a scrollable summary of contract gain\/loss entries, based on customers.  
  
 You fill in the **Contract Gain\/Loss \(Customers\)** window to determine what will be shown in the matrix.  
  
 You can specify which customers are included in the window by setting filters in the **Customer No. Filter** and  **Ship\-to Filter** fields. If you do not set any filters, the window will include information about all customers.  
  
 In the **Period Start** field, you can specify the starting date of the period that you want to view.  
  
 You use the **View by** field to select the time interval.  
  
 You use the **View as** field to determine what type of amount will be shown in the period columns: **Net Change**, which displays the net change for each period or **Balance at Date**, which displays the value as of the last day in each period.  
  
 You choose **Show Matrix** to view the matrix. The first three columns contain the time intervals and the total gain\/loss amount for each interval, and the remaining columns contain the total gain\/loss amount for each customer for the same time intervals.  
  
 When you scroll up and down, the amounts \(in LCY\) are calculated according to the time interval you have selected.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  If you have set the time interval to **Day** and you want to scroll over a long period, you can do it faster by shifting to a larger interval such as **Quarter**. When you have found the desired period, you can shift back to the original interval to see the data in more detail.
