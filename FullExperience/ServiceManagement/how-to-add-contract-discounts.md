# How to: Add Contract Discounts
You can add contract discounts on services for contract quotes and service contracts. The discounts can be on spare parts in particular service item groups, on resource hours for resources in particular resource groups, and on particular service costs.  
  
### To add a contract discount to a service contract quotes  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Contract Quotes**, and choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the quote you want to add discounts for.  
  
3.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Quote** group, choose **Service Discounts**. The **\($ N\_6058 Contract\/Service Discounts $\)** window opens.  
  
4.  To create a new contract discount, on the **Home** tab, in the **New** group, choose **New**.  
  
5.  Fill in the fields in the **\($ N\_6058 Contract\/Service Discounts $\)** window.  
  
 Repeat these steps for each service discount you want to add to the selected contract quote.  
  
 To add contract discounts directly to a service contract, perform similar steps from the ![Shortcut icon](../BusinessFunctionality/OnlineMaps/media/shortcutcoldicon.gif "shortcutColdIcon")**[\($ N\_6051 Service Contract $\)](DynamicsNAV:////runpage?Page=6051)** window.
