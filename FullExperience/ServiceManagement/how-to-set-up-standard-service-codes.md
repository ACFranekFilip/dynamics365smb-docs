# How to: Set Up Standard Service Codes
You can use standard service codes to create service documents with similar combinations of service lines. If you set up standard service codes and then link standard service lines to them, this will allow you to automatically insert service lines in service documents. You can assign the standard service codes to service item groups.  
  
### To set up a standard service code  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Standard Service Codes**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Create a new standard service code. On the **Home** tab, in the **New** group, choose **New**.  
  
3.  On the **General** FastTab, specify the code, description of the service it represents, and the currency linked to the code.  
  
4.  Fill in the service lines linked to this service code.  
  
5.  Repeat these steps for each code you want to set up.
