# How to: Set Up Loaners
You can use the **Loaner Card** window to set up loaners that you can lend to customers to replace service items while they are in service.  
  
### To set up a loaner  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Loaners**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Create a new loaner card. On the **Home** tab, in the **New** group, choose **New**.  
  
3.  In the **No.** field, enter a number for the loaner.  
  
     Alternatively, if you have set up number series for loaners in the **Service Mgt. Setup** window, you can press the Enter key to enter the next available loaner number.  
  
4.  Fill in the **Description**, **Description 2**, and **Serial No.** fields.  
  
5.  In the **Unit of Measure Code** field, select the relevant unit of measure.  
  
 Repeat these steps for each loaner you want to create.
