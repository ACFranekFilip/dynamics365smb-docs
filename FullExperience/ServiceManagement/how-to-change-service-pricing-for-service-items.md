# How to: Change Service Pricing for Service Items
You can manually change the breakdown of service pricing for a service item in the **Service Item Worksheet** window.  
  
### To change service pricing for a service item  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **\($ N\_5900 Service Order $\)**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the relevant service order and open the service order card.  
  
3.  Select the service item line that you want to change the service pricing for. On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Line** group, choose **Service Item Worksheet**.  
  
4.  In the **Service Item Worksheet** window, you can edit the fields and delete or insert records.  
  
 You cannot assign a service price group to a service item line or create service pricing for it manually if you have posted as **Invoice** the service lines linked to the line.
