# How to: Assign Service Zones to Customers
You can assign service zones to customers in the **Customer Card** window. When you allocate a resource, for example, a technician, to a service task that is to be performed at the customer site, you can then select a resource that is assigned to the same service zone as the customer.  
  
 You set up how you use service zones in the **Service Zones Option** field in the **Service Mgt. Setup** window.  
  
### To assign a service zone to customer  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the customer that you want to assign a service zone to and open the customer card.  
  
3.  On the **General** FastTab, in the **Service Zone Code** field, select the service zone you want to assign to the customer.  
  
 Repeat these steps for each customer you want to assign a service zone to.
