# How to: Set Up Work-Hour Templates
You can use the **Work\-Hour Template** window to set up templates that contain the typical working hours in your company. For example, you can create templates for full time technicians and part time technicians. You can use work\-hour templates when you add capacity to resources.  
  
### To set up a work\-hour template  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Work Hour Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Create a new work\-hour template. On the **Home** tab, in the **New** group, choose **New**.  
  
3.  Fill in the **Code** and **Description** fields.  
  
4.  In the **Monday**, **Tuesday**, **Wednesday**, **Thursday**, **Friday**, **Saturday**, and **Sunday** fields, enter the number of work\-hours for each day of the week. The **Total per Week** field is calculated automatically.  
  
 Repeat these steps for each work\-hour template you want to create.
