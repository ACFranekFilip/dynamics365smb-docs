# How to: Set Up Customer Templates
You may often have contacts or potential customers asking for quotes. These contacts or potential customers may not yet be registered as customers in [!INCLUDE[navnow](../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)]. In order for you to make service quotes for these requests, you should create and define one or more customer templates. You can then use the templates in the quotation phase, so that you do not have to create a customer. You use this template to pass on information that is necessary to create a customer from a contact card.  
  
### To set up a customer template  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Customer Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Create a new customer template card. On the **Home** tab, in the **New** group, choose **New**.  
  
3.  On the **General** FastTab of the customer template card, enter a code and a description for the customer template in the **Code** and **Description** fields respectively.  
  
4.  The other fields, such as **Country\/Region Code**, **Territory Code**, and **Language Code**, are used as search criteria and could be filled in.  
  
5.  The **Gen. Bus. Posting Group** and **Customer Posting Group** fields must be filled in.  
  
6.  The remaining fields do not have to be filled in and can be filled in only if you want to specify information for these fields.  
  
7.  You have now set up the customer template.  
  
 Repeat these steps for each customer template you want to set up.
