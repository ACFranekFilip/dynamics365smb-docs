# How to: Create Service Items in Service Orders
When you receive items for service that you want to register as service items, you can create them as service items in the **Service Order** or **Service Quote** windows.  
  
### To create service items within a service order  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Open the service order that you want to create service items for.  
  
3.  Enter a new service item line.  
  
4.  Fill in the **Serial No.** field.  
  
5.  Confirm the subsequent message.  
  
6.  Fill in the **Description** field.  
  
7.  Choose **Actions**![Action Menu icon](../DesignAndEngineering/media/actionmenuicon.png "actionMenuIcon"), choose **Functions**, and then choose **Create Service Item**, and confirm the subsequent message.  
  
 A number is assigned to the service item and a service item card is created. The **Service Item No.** field is filled in with the number of the new service item.
