# How to: Insert Starting Fees for Service Items
When working on service items in service orders, you may need to register a starting fee for the service of specific service items. The following procedure shows how to register the starting fee in the **Service Item Worksheet** window.  
  
 Before you can insert starting fees, you must define which service cost is a starting fee in the **Service Order Starting Fee** field in the **Service Mgt. Setup** window.  
  
### To insert a starting fee for a service item  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **\($ N\_5915 Service Tasks $\)**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the line that includes the relevant service item. On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Service Tasks** group, choose **Item Worksheet**.  
  
3.  On the **Lines** FastTab, select the relevant line, and choose **Actions**![Action Menu icon](../DesignAndEngineering/media/actionmenuicon.png "actionMenuIcon"), choose **Functions**, and then choose **Insert Starting Fee**.  
  
     A service line of type **Cost** is inserted with the starting fee. The starting fee applies to the selected service item.
