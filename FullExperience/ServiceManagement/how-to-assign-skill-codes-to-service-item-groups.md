# How to: Assign Skill Codes to Service Item Groups
Servicing items that belong to certain service item groups may require specific skills. If this is the case, you must assign skill codes to these service item groups.  
  
 You set up how you use skill codes in the **Resource Skills Option** field in the **Service Mgt. Setup** window.  
  
### To assign a skill code to a service item group  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Item Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the service item group to which you want to assign a skill code.  
  
3.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Resource** group, choose **Resource**, and then choose **Resource Skills**. The **Resource Skills** window opens.  
  
     The **Type** and **No.** fields will already be filled in with information for the selected service item group.  
  
4.  In the **Skill Code** field, select the relevant skill code.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  You can only assign a skill code that differs from the existing ones for the selected service item group.
