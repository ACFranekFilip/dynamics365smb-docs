# How to: Undo Service Shipments
You can cancel a service shipment that has been posted by mistake or contains some erroneous information.  
  
### To undo a service shipment  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Posted Service Shipments**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Open the relevant posted service shipment.  
  
3.  On the **Lines** FastTab, choose **Actions**![Action Menu icon](../DesignAndEngineering/media/actionmenuicon.png "actionMenuIcon"), choose **Shipment**, and then choose **Service Shipment Lines**. The **Posted Service Shipment Lines** window opens.  
  
4.  Select the relevant line.  
  
5.  On the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Undo Shipment**.  
  
 A balancing service shipment line is inserted with negative corresponding values in the **Quantity Invoiced** and **Quantity** fields. Relevant ledger entries are also generated.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  You will not be able to undo a service shipment that has already been invoiced.
