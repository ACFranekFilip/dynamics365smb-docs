# Determine Service Offerings
When you set up service management, you have to decide what services to offer customers and the schedule for those services. A service is a type of work performed by one or more resources and provided to a customer. For example, a service could be a type of computer repair. A service item is the equipment or item needing servicing, for example, the computer needing repair, installed at a specific customer. You can set up services as part of a group of related repair or maintenance items.  
  
 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them. These tasks are listed in the order in which they are generally performed.
