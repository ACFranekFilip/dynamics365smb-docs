# How to: Assign Service Item Groups to Items
You can assign service item groups to items on the item card. The service item group determines whether the items are automatically registered as service items when sold. Service items representing items belong to the same service item group as the items.  
  
### To assign a service item group to an item  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the item that you want to assign a service item group to and open the **Item** card.  
  
3.  On the **General** FastTab, in the **Service Item Group** field, select the relevant service item group.  
  
 Repeat these steps for each item that you want to assign to a service item group.
