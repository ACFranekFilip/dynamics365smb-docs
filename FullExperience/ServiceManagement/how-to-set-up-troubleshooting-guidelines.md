# How to: Set Up Troubleshooting Guidelines
You can use the **Troubleshooting** window to set up troubleshooting guidelines for service items to help the technician solve problems or set up a list of questions to ask relating to the specific items.  
  
### To set up troubleshooting guidelines  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Troubleshooting**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Create new troubleshooting guidelines for a service item. On the **Home** tab, in the **New** group, choose **New**.  
  
3.  In the **No.** field, enter a number for the troubleshooting guidelines.  
  
     Alternatively, if you have set up number series for troubleshooting in the **Service Mgt. Setup** window, you can press the Enter key to enter the next available troubleshooting number.  
  
4.  Fill in the **Description** field.  
  
5.  On the troubleshooting lines, in the **Comment** field, enter the relevant text for the troubleshooting guidelines.  
  
 Repeat these steps for each new set of troubleshooting guidelines you want to create.
