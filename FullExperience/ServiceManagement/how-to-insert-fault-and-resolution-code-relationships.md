# How to: Insert Fault and Resolution Code Relationships
To be able to see the most common methods of repair for particular item faults when you are servicing the items, you need to build up information on fault\/resolution codes relationships. Use the **Insert Fault\/Resol. Codes Relationships** batch job to find all the combination of fault and resolution codes in posted service orders and record them in the **Fault\/Resol. Codes Relationships** window.  
  
### To insert fault\/resolution codes relationships  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Insert Fault\/Resol. Codes Relationships**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **From Date** field, enter the starting date of the period you want to include in the batch job.  
  
3.  In the **To Date** field, enter the ending date of the period you want to include in the batch job.  
  
4.  Select the **Relation Based on Service Item Group** field if you want the relationships to be grouped by service item groups.  
  
5.  Select the **Retain Manually Inserted Rec.** field if you want to retain the records that you have already inserted manually in the **Fault\/Resol. Codes Relationships** window.  
  
6.  Choose the **OK** button.  
  
7.  Confirm the subsequent message.
