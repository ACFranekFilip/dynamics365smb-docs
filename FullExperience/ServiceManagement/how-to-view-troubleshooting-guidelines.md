# How to: View Troubleshooting Guidelines
When you register service item lines in service orders or quotes, you can view troubleshooting guidelines for the service items in the **Troubleshooting** window.  
  
### To view troubleshooting guidelines  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Open the relevant service order.  
  
3.  Select the service item line you want to view troubleshooting guidelines for.  
  
4.  Choose **Actions**![Action Menu icon](../DesignAndEngineering/media/actionmenuicon.png "actionMenuIcon"), choose **Line**, and then choose **Troubleshooting**.  
  
 If there are troubleshooting guidelines for the service item on the line, they appear in the **Troubleshooting** window. Troubleshooting guidelines can be assigned specifically to the service item on the line, to the item on the line, or to the service item group on the line. If there are not any troubleshooting guidelines, a message is displayed.
