# How to: Insert Extended Text in Service Orders
If you have set up extended texts for standard texts, you can insert extended texts for service lines that include standard text codes.  
  
### To insert extended texts  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Open the relevant service order.  
  
3.  Choose **Actions**![Action Menu icon](../DesignAndEngineering/media/actionmenuicon.png "actionMenuIcon"), choose **Order**, and then choose **Service Lines**. The **Service Lines** window opens.  
  
4.  Select the service line with the standard text code you want to insert extended text for. On the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Insert Ext. Texts**.  
  
     A new service line is created with the extended text with the language code of the customer in the service order.
