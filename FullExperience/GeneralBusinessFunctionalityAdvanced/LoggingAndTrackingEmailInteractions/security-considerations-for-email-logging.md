# Security Considerations for Email Logging
Email messages received through the Internet can have fake sender addresses. That means that interaction log entries in [!INCLUDE[navnow](../../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)] that are created from email logging could potentially include fake addresses and should be reviewed for security reasons.  
  
 Before opening any mail message, make sure that you recognize the senderâ€™s email address.  
  
 In addition, we recommend that a [!INCLUDE[navnow](../../ApplicationDesign/includes/navnow_md.md)] administrator follow the latest security best practices guidance.  
  
 For more information about the steps that you can take to make your application more secure, see [Security TechCenter](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=80207).
