# Troubleshooting [!INCLUDE[d365acc_long](includes/d365acc_long_md.md)]
Signing up for [!INCLUDE[d365acc](includes/d365acc_md.md)] is easy and can be done very quickly. Adding clients to the dashboard is also easy, but this article addresses issues that you may have on the way.

## What email address can I use with [!INCLUDE[d365acc](includes/d365acc_md.md)]?
[!INCLUDE[d365acc](includes/d365acc_md.md)] requires that you use a work, or school, email address to sign up. [!INCLUDE[d365acc](includes/d365acc_md.md)] does not support email addresses provided by consumer email services or telecommunication providers. This includes outlook.com, hotmail.com, gmail.com, and others.  

If you try to sign up with a personal email address, you will get a message indicating to use a work or school email address.  

## Why can't I connect to my client's data?
There can be a couple of reasons, including the following:

- The URL in the **Client URL** field is not valid  

  Go to **Manage Clients**, open the client that you cannot connect to, and then choose **Test Client URL**.  
- The client's company is currently offline, for example if it being upgraded

  In your dashboard, choose the **Tools** menu item, and then choose **Check Errors**. This opens a list with technical details, so you might want to contact your administrator if you're seeing errors.
